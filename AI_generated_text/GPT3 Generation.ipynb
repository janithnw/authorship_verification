Lyrics of their Midgardian love song whispers through his lips to her as she slowly smiles to him. \"We must be leaving now,\" Thor says sadly, walking up next to his brother.

The princess of his dreams keep his spirits up. Visions of their future together appear before his eyes. Alexandra becoming one with Loki as king and queen of Asgard. Not only that, they become parents of a little heir and a little heiress. A single tear escapes his eye. Loki really hopes that he gets the throne not only for him, but also for Alexandra. Even though Thor is willing to help her as well, he wants to give her a better life because she deserves it more then anything. Suddenly, two palace guards approach the energy force door. No words spoke, just stares. They open the door and grab the chains, pulling the God of Mischief up the stairs towards the throne room. The throne room only has King Odin and Thor. His brother looks over his shoulder towards him. He too is worried and concerned for Loki\"s fate. Loki steps forward when the chains are removed from the guards. King Odin orders them away so he talk to his sons in secret. \"Thor,\" his mighty voice speaks, \"tell me Loki\"s behavior in Midgard.\" \"His behavior changed from bad to good,\" the God of Thunder replies to his father, \"he has learned to give others respect, helped others and most importantly, Loki fell in love with a mortal female.\" \"Loki,\" he speaks, making him to look up, \"please tell me about this mortal female that you have romantic feelings for.\"\n",

He tells him of the dreams they have shared together and how he wants to make them come true. Odin listens intently, his face unreadable. When Loki finishes, Odin looks at Thor with a knowing look before turning back to Loki. \"I can see that you truly care for this woman,\" he says, \"and I can see that you are willing to do anything for her.\" Odin pauses for a moment before continuing, \"I will grant you the throne of Asgard if you prove yourself worthy.\" Loki looks up in surprise, not expecting such an offer from his father.

Jane loves Father George like a fatherly figure like I do. So having her speak coldly of him was unnerving. \"Jane what is wrong with you?\" \"Nothing\"s wrong with me!\" It becomes into a shouting fight. Little did we know, the whole team is watching from the tower. *The Tower* *No One\"s POV* Tony let out a whistle before speaking, \"they never fight like this.\" \"What\n",
      "are we going to do?\" Natasha asked. \"Her behavior is worser than I thought,\" Father George sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, \"if she continues to be in denial, a death will occur.\" \"How can you be sure?\" Pepper asked, worried for her friend. \"I have been on Alexandra\"s side for many years trying to keep positivity around her because she has a \"curse\" on her.\" \"What kind of curse?\" Bruce asked, catching his attention. \"She lost her biological parents at the age of three, making her an orphan. Jane\"s parents adopted her and made her life like hell\n",

There\"s nothing wrong with me and if you and the others continue.....you know what I don\"t want to be your sister anymore!\" Jane\"s screaming made everyone to see the screen. Alexandra sat there stunned as Jane storms off. Loki watches in fear to see his beloved princess about to break down. Thor feels his blood boiling inside, seeing this.\n",
      "*Alexandra\"s POV* Even well into the evening hours, the statement that Jane said is still fresh. I lost the last of my family because of that house. My nerves are shaking. Even though I have cried over things like this, tears will not come out. Am I in shock? I am drinking some iced water while staring out New York City through the some large windows. The city became home since I was eighteen years old when I joined the team. Friends with people that I would never have thought I will become friends with. Especially with Thor and Loki.\n",
      "SInce childhood my knowledge of Norse mythology grew and grew, not knowing why. Now I know why, but still.... Will my life be better in Asgard? Or should I stay in Midgard hoping for the best? I am so confused! \"Lady Alexandra?\" Turning around, Thor and Loki stand there staring back. \"We were speaking with the team and we all agreed on something,\" Thor speaks up. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Everyone believes that you life will be better if you come with us to Asgard,\" Loki explains. I dropped my drink and it shattered at my feet. \"What?\" I\n",
      "asked in shock. \"The end of Loki\"s punishment is growing near, so his fate will be named,\" Thor explained. \"Rather I get sentenced to death or the throne,\" Loki says softly, approaching towards me to hold hands with me, \"Brother Thor and I will make sure you will become an immortal citizen of Asgard.\" My eyebrows raise up at the new name for Thor. The corners of my lips curl up as I feel a few tears fall down. I nodded my head, accepting the offer. Loki smiles big, pecking my lips and hugs me tightly. Thor joins in the\n",

Chapter 22: *No One\"s POV* \"Do you really have to leave?\" Alexandra asked crying in her immortal lover\"s arms. \"I have to,\" he answers sadly, hugging her tight. \"But what if I don\"t see you again?\" \"Don\"t say such words,\" he says, making her face him, \"we are still going to be together one way or another, even it means I will make war.\" \"I love you so much Prince Loki Laufeyson of Asgard.\" \"I love you so much more Alexandra Raymond-Foster of Midgard.\" He pulls her into a long kiss and slowly pulling away.\n",

Loki still has his arms around Alexandra while slowly moving up to teleporting up to the sky. Her arms raises up to her lover until she couldn\"t see her lover and/or best friend/brother. More tears run down her face as she falls down to her knees on the grassy grounds. No matter how much she doesn\"t want to think about it, that could be the last time she\n",
      "will see her soulmate. Loki\"s her everything to first kiss, boyfriend, love, everything. The Adam to her Eve, Romeo to Juliet. A hand gently drops on her shoulder. She looks up to see her good friend Clint aka Hawkeye staring down to her with sadness in his eyes as well. He kneels down to hug her as she cries her doe like eyes out. \"Don\"t think that you will never going to see Loki again,\" he whispers to her softly, stroking her hair, \"you are going to see him again and he will make sure that your life will be\n",
      "better.\" She hugs him tighter for comfort. *Later that night* Alexandra didn\"t want to sleep that night, but she knew she has to because she wouldn\"t focus on time. A green tank top with black sweats clothed her body as she gets into bed. Loki\"s side feels cold, colder than his powers, not the familiar warmth coming from his body. Teary eyes look at the side as she slowly falls asleep. All of sudden, her head starts to feel weird. Hurting yet feeling dizzy even though she\"s laying down on her side. Deep breaths are made as she\"s having trouble\n",
      "of breathing. \"What\"s going on?' she asked to herself, opening her eyes in a panic. Before she can call out for help to JAVIS, she suddenly falls unconsciousness. *Asgard* Loki Laufeyson has chains on his wrists and ankles as he is in the palace dungeons. He\"s been here for hours to the point she doesn\"t know if it\"s still day or night. Fingertips touch the emerald on the golden chain that hangs around his neck. The princess of his dreams keep his spirits up. Visions of their future together appear before his eyes. Alexandra becoming one with Loki as king\n",
      "and queen of Asgard. Not only that, they become parents of a little heir and a little heiress. A single tear escapes his eye. Loki really hopes that he gets the throne not only for him, but also for Alexandra. Even though Thor is willing to help her as well, he wants to give her a better life because she deserves it more then anything. Suddenly, two palace guards approach the energy force door. No words spoke, just stares. They open the door and grab the chains, pulling the God of Mischief up the stairs towards the throne room. The\n",
      "throne room only has King Odin and Thor. His brother looks over his shoulder towards him. He too is worried and concerned for Loki\"s fate. Loki steps forward when the chains are removed from the guards. King Odin orders them away so he talk to his sons in secret. \"Thor,\" his mighty voice speaks, \"tell me Loki\"s behavior in Midgard.\" \"His behavior changed from bad to good,\" the God of Thunder replies to his father, \"he has learned to give others respect, helped others and most importantly, Loki fell in love with a mortal female.\" \"Loki,\" he speaks, making him\n",
      "to look up, \"please tell me about this mortal female that you have romantic feelings for.\" \"Her name is Alexandra,\" he answers softly, \"a young Midgardian female born with Asgardian beauty.\" This caught the All-Father\"s interest. \"She understands me more then anyone could because her past is simular to mine. Selfless, beautiful, intelligent, prefers the simpler life similar to Asgard. Her favorite forms of entertainment sparks my interests in reading, enjoying time together, and some of Midgardian entertainment.\" He touches the necklace once again. \"She has given me this as a gift for a tradition in Midgardian holiday called Christmas.\"\n",
      "He smiles softly, thinking of her then frowns sadly, \"No matter how much she tries to be good and protects Midgard with her magical powers, horrible things will continue on to take her down. She sees good in many thing that no one sees. She\"s Alexandra, Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" His majesty, the king, watches his youngest son describe this Goddess of Hidden Beauty. Such emotion and passion also love in his eyes. Loki is truly indeed in love. \"Loki,\" he finally speaks then smiles, \"you are next in line for the throne.\" Both brothers stare at their father stunned.\n",
      "\"Your mother had visions of a female from Midgard and always believe that you and her are meant to be. She kept in secrecy because she wanted you to fall in love wit her without knowing her.\" \"Father....\" Thor and Loki were speechless to hear this. \"You will take the throne as king along with your lady as queen. Now go inform Alexandra in Midgard. Also I would like to meet the Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" \"Thank you Father,\" Loki smiles big to him. \"You are welcome King Loki,\" he smiles back. Thor and Loki leaves the throne room still\n",
      "stunned of what just happened. \"Congratulations Brother,\" Thor grins, pulling him into a hug. \"Is this for real Brother?\" Loki feels speechless. \"It is real Loki!\" he looks at him with his hands on his shoulders. \"You and Lady Alexandra are becoming King and Queen of Asgard!\" \"That\"s only if she accepts,\" Loki noted. \"She will accept. Now come on, let\" go and inform her!\" The grins appears on Loki\"s face again as they teleport to Midgard. Chapter 23: *No One\"s POV* *Midgard* For some odd reason, the gods were pulled to another location instead of the Tower. Then they\n",
      "step foot on the Earthly grounds, a horrible sight greeted them. Alexandra\"s childhood home is on fire! Flames are over twenty feet tall, covering almost every inch of the structure. Midgardian firefighters try to put out the fire when they see Tony in his Ironman suit flying around in a panic. \"Man of Iron!\" Thor calls for his teammate. \"Huh?\" Tony says confused, but notices the Asgardians on the ground. \"Thor! Reindeer Games!\" he calls back, flying down to them. Loki growls under his breath at the nickname. \"First of all, it has been a week since we last saw\n",
      "you two,\" Tony explained, \"and this week has gone bad to worse.\" \"Where are Lady Alexandra and Lady Jane?\" Loki asked, getting seriously worried. \"Alexandra has been in the hospital since the first night and we just got Jane into the hospital.\" \"What happened?!\" Thor asked, freaking out. \"Follow me and I will show you.\" The hospital is in the middle of the city and it\"s waiting room is filled with the team. You can see in their eyes that they\"re happy t see the Asgardian gods, but the happiness disappear due to the current situation. \"I am looking for\n",
      "the boyfriends of both Jane Foster and Alexandra Raymond-Foster,\" a head doctor asked, approaching the team. \"We are them,\" Thor speaks for them. \"Is Alexandra alright?\" Loki asked, softly, really concerned. \"Please come with me,\" the doctor says, walking back to where he was. Thor and Loki quickly follows him. He leads them to a room that has a curtain separating them from someone. It opens to reveal a sight that startles them gratefully. A female looking for wearing some clothing that\"s burned off and barely covering the nessoristy areas. Skin colored in deep red and hair is missing. The\n",
      "look in the female\"s eyes is filled with pure pain. \"Jane Foster,\" the doctor says to the gods, letting them approach her. The God of Thunder slowly walks to her side in disbelief. \"What happened to her?\" Loki asked the doctor. \"She was at the source of the fire in the home resulting her into untreatable bruns.\" \"You don\"t mean....\" \"I\"m afraid so. We are doing the best we could for now. Now let me show you Alexandra. Jane needs to focus on staying awake and breathing on her own.\" His brother slowly removes himself from Jane\"s room to follow\n",
      "Loki and the doctor. \"Take care of my sister,' The God of Mischief hears the mortal female speak to him through his mind. \"I will,' he responded through his mind. Doctor leads them to a far location of the hospital. THe long walk is making Loki more worried for his one true love. Thor has mixed emotions running through his mind. After seeing Jane like that, he couldn\"t even imagine what Alexandra\"s condition could be. Soon he stops to a curtain wall still in the hallway. Hands on the curtains he takes a deep breath and open them. Loki and\n",
      "Thor gasped in shock. A large chamber like structure greets them. \"This is called a Pressurized Oxygen Chamber. It\"s a chamber that holds pure oxygen in air pressure two to three times higher than normal. Alexandra has been in this chamber because he has carbon monoxide poisoning.\" \"What\"s that?\" Loki asked. \"Carbon Dioxide is a silent killer. In a normal residence there shouldn\"t be any, but when we were called, in Alexandra\"s home was filled with the highest amounts of Carbon Dioxide. When a mortal breaths, what they breath will not only go into the lungs, but everywhere in the\n",
      "body. When inhaled with the poison, it must be treated immediately. Unfortunately, in Alexandra\"s case, she\"s fighting for her life.\" He looks at the chamber. \"Not everyone gets the chamber therapy because it is only used for the deadly cases.\" Loki didn\"t know what to say. A poison is killing his princess? \"We have set up a camera to monitor her inside,\" he turns back to the gods, \"would you like to see her?\" \"Yes,\" Loki says quickly and edgerly. He pulls out a technology device and on the screen shows Alexandra lays flat on her back on a bed\n",
      "inside the chamber. She looks lifeless and almost looking dead. Loki\"s immortal heart stops seeing her like this. \"At this point,\" Doctor speaks again, \"she will be in the chamber for one more night and we will take both Alexandra and Jane in one room.\" \"Are they going....?\" Thor didn\"t want to finish the sentence. \"We\"re doing the best we could.\" *Next morning* No one couldn\"t sleep last night. Two friends are fighting for their lives. Loki and THor wanted to stay together for support and comfort. During breakfast, they didn\"t feel like eating. All they want is to get\n",
      "to the hospital as soon as possible. Especially for Thor and Loki. Each minute, maybe every second, goes by possibly to the point we will never see them anymore. Finally, their hospital visit begins. Jane still lays down in serious pain. Thor didn\"t want to get near her so he wouldn\"t increase it. A cloud of sadness cloak over everyone as they share the same thought. Jane forcefully looks to the door to see a couple of nurses wheeling Alexandra next to her. She\"s still unconsciousness from the poison, but she\"s breathing on her own. Alexandra is positioned funeral like\n",
      "which kills Jane inside. Father George stands on the other side of Jane, performing a prayer so Jane can find the way to Heaven. \"Now Jane,\" he says to her, having her look at him, \"go to the light.\" Her eyes move around trying to find it. Somehow when they land on Alexandra, there\"s the light. Alexandra\"s the light. Slowly she moves her hand up to reach her sister as she whispers, \"I am so sorry, I love you my little sister.\" After saying those words, her eyes closed and she takes her final breath. Alexandra suddenly awakes with her\n",
      "eyes wide open as she gasps loudly. She quickly sits up, trying to figure out what\"s going on. Onyx eyes look around for her surroundings. Everyone she knew is here, but when she turn to the female next to her, she stares at her for a few moments before letting her eyes closed and bowed her head in sadness knowing it is her sister. Chapter 24: *Alexandra\"s POV* After a week from the death, Jane\"s funeral arrived. I sit on the bed all dressed for the morning occasion. It\"s her favorite dress. She gave it to me one birthday because\n",
      "she didn\"t want to get rid of it and I fit in perfectly. My long hair falls down in waves as I try to lower the short skirt down more on my fishnet tights. Father George will be performing the funeral and yet I am not looking forward to it. A couple of tears begin to fall down my cheek and down to long sleeved arm. They won. My parents won. Their goal of making my life miserable has succeeded by taking the last person from my family. I no longer have an actually family. Familiar fingers run themselves against\n",
      "my cheek. My dark eyes meet the dark emeralds of my immortal prince. They are filled with emotions such as worry, concern, fear, etc. I gently grab his warm hand with cold hands. My eyes closed, trying not to cry. No words are spoken when he escorts me to the living room. Everyone gathers here before heading to the funeral home. Tony takes all of us there with one of his transportations. My head is low as I allow the silent depression cover my whole body. Everyone didn\"t make a sound which is good for this occasion. Soon we arrived\n",
      "to the funeral home where Father George has the body of Jane Foster. The team, Pepper, Thor, Loki, and I filled up the home with no outsiders. \"Today should have been a happy day knowing that the personal war finally come to an end,\" Father George speaks, performing the funeral, \"but we have lost a friend, a lover, and a sister. She will be deeply missed.\" Each member did a small speech for Jane and I am the last one. With a heavy heart, I stand in front of everyone. \"Jane Foster saw me as a sister even though I\n",
      "didn\"t know what a sibling was when her parents adopted me. No matter how much her parents hated me, she was there to love and protect me from anything. In return, I was there for her personal life problems. I couldn\"t be anymore grateful for having her in my life. I will always love and miss her dearly.\" I sit back down in my seat in between Thor and Loki. *The Tower* Later, she hang out in the living room area. All of us try to cheer up with the drinks and food provided for us, but we know that\n",
      "it\"s going to be a long healing process. I\"m sure that everyone will be better by tomorrow. As for myself, I am not sure how am I going to feel. \"...in terms of family,\" I overhear Father George talking to my teammates, \"she\"s truly alone.\" Tears silently fall, but in small rivers. So many years of crying in sorrow and now it feels like I cannot cry anymore. No matter how much my heart is broken. \"Lady Alexandra?\" Thor asked, coming up to me. \"Thor,\" I speak before looking down to the floor. \"My apologizes.\" \"Oh no Thor!\" I look\n",
      "up to him. \"It\"s my fault that Jane\"s gone.\" \"But she\"s your sister.\" \"Also your lover.\" \"I believe there\"s a Midgardian saying that things happen for a reason or people come into our lives.\" \"Yes there is.\" \"Maybe in a way, it\"s Jane that is letting you go so you can live your life. She will be watching you from Midgard Heaven wherever you go.\" Maybe he\"s right. Jane won\"t be taking care of me forever and in a strange way she\"s letting me go. I look up to my brother before hugging him. He hugs me back. Thor\"s my\n",
      "family in all of the realms. Everyone has given me their sympathy and empathy throughout the day. Loki holds me close, letting his warmth and comfort slowly take away the pain. \"Alexandra?\" he asked, brushing his fingers against my jaw and chin. \"Yes Loki?\" I look up to him. \"I was going to ask you within a few days, but if it\"s alright with you, I can ask you now.\" \"What is it Loki?\" \"My fate became to be king of Asgard,\" my eyes widen with a soft smile, \"but before I do become king, I would like for you\n",
      "to spend some time in Asgard.\" \"For how long?\" \"An Asgardian week.\" \"When do we leave?\" \"This Saturday.\" \"Loki,\" I smiled a little more, \"I would love to.\" He smiles, seeing me smile. *The next morning* \"Thank you so much for everything,\" I hugged Father George with a smile. \"You\"re very welcome,\" he hugs back, \"I just hoped it was going to end on a better note.\" \"Me too, but the house is gone for good.\" \"Yes indeed. Well,\" he smiles, looking at me, \"maybe the next time we see each other, it\"ll be you getting married.\" I chuckled, \"for\n",

Chapter 25: *Alexandra\"s POV* All of my clothing has magically turn into more goddess like and more appropriate for Asgard. The dress I am wearing an emerald green strapless dress with a sheer black fabric over it in a similar form of a sleeveless coat or jacket. A thin golden ribbon ties everything together under my breasts. Long dark as night hair falls down my back and natural looking makeup on my face. I am packing up hoping I\"ve got everything I might need. Since Asgard is considered\n",
      "more simpler than Midgard, very few things are needed.

      "\"But why is it here?\" I asked, still confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was sent by Lord Voldemort,\" Daddy said grimly. \"He wants to take over the Forbidden Forest and use its power for his own evil purposes.\" He looked around at all of us with\n",
      "a determined expression on his face. \"But we won't let him do that,\" he said firmly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded in agreement, feeling a surge of courage run through me as I held my children close to me protectively. Daddy then cast a powerful spell that sent the Dementor away from us and back into the darkness from whence it came. \n",
      "\n",
      "We all breathed a sigh of relief as we watched it disappear into the night sky, but we knew this was only the beginning of our fight against Voldemort's forces. We had to be prepared for whatever else he might throw our way in order to protect our home and our\n",
      "people from harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's alright,\" he says, his voice thick with emotion. \"He's gone now.\" I feel a lump in my throat and tears prick my eyes. I take a deep breath and try to compose myself. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whisper, not knowing what else to say. Hagrid nods and turns back to the lake, skimming more rocks across the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stand there in silence for a few moments before Hagrid finally speaks again. \"It's alright,\" he says softly. \"He had a good life here with me.\" He looks up at me with a sad smile on his face. \"He was a good hippogriff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I nod, not trusting\n",
      "myself to speak without crying. We stand there for a few more moments before Hagrid finally breaks the silence again. \"Come on,\" he says, turning away from the lake and heading back towards Hogwarts castle. \"Let's get you back inside.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "We walk in silence until we reach the gates of Hogwarts, where Hagrid stops and turns to me once more. He looks at me with an expression of understanding and compassion that I hadn't seen before in him. He reaches out and takes my hand in his own, squeezing it gently before letting go again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It'll be alright,\" he says softly, giving me one last sad smile before turning away\n",
      "and walking off into the night. I watch him go until he disappears from sight, then turn away myself and head back inside Hogwarts castle, feeling strangely comforted by his words despite my sadness over Buckbeak's passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I follow the map, my heart pounding in my chest. I'm so close to finding out what happened to Buckbeak. I turn a corner and see Pettigrew standing there, talking to Lucius Malfoy. I can't hear what they're saying, but it's clear that Malfoy is trying to convince Pettigrew of something. I take a step closer and Malfoy notices me. He looks at me with a cold stare and then turns back to\n",
      "Pettigrew. \"You must do this for me,\" he says. \"It's the only way.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Pettigrew nods his head in agreement and then turns to me. \"Harry Potter,\" he says with a smirk on his face. \"You should not be here.\" He takes a step towards me and I take a step back, my wand raised in defense. \n",

      "\"What have you done?\" I demand, my voice shaking with anger and fear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Malfoy laughs coldly and steps forward as well, his wand pointed at me menacingly. \"I have done what was necessary,\" he says calmly. \"Buckbeak will be put to death tomorrow morning.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "My heart sinks as the reality of the situation hits\n",
      "me like a ton of bricks. Tears fill my eyes as I realize that there is nothing I can do to save Buckbeak now. But then an idea comes into my head - maybe there is something else that can be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me with a hint of surprise, as if he hadn't expected me to know the names. \"It's a Marauder's Map,\" he said, his voice softening. \"It shows the entire castle and grounds, and it can even show the location of certain people.\" He paused for a moment before continuing. \"I suggest you keep this map safe and use it wisely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded in agreement, feeling\n",
      "a bit overwhelmed by all of this information. I thanked Professor Snape for his help and tucked the map away in my pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I walked away, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of admiration for him. He had been so kind to me, despite his usual coldness. I knew that I could trust him with my secrets and that he would never betray me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I was surprised to find Professor Snape waiting for me outside my classroom door. He handed me an envelope with my name on it and said, \"This is from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.\" Inside was an invitation to join\n",
      "their secret club - The Marauders! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was ecstatic! I had heard stories about the Marauders from other students but never thought that I would be invited to join them! Professor Snape gave me a knowing smile before walking away without another word. \n",
      "\n",
      "That night, I met up with the Marauders in an old abandoned classroom on the seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle. We talked late into the night about our adventures and plans for the future. It felt like we were part of something special - something magical!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded and left the office, my mind racing with thoughts. I had to find Peter Pettigrew, but how? I knew\n",
      "he was in the castle somewhere, but where? I had to find him before Sirius Black did. As I walked through the halls of Hogwarts, I noticed a few students looking at me strangely. It was then that I realized that they must have heard about my mission. Word travels fast in this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued walking until I reached the Unknown House. It was a strange place, filled with secrets and mysteries. As soon as I stepped inside, a chill ran down my spine. The walls were lined with books and artifacts from all over the world. There were also strange symbols carved into the walls that seemed to\n",
      "be some kind of code or language.\n",
      "\n",
      "I searched through the bookshelves for any clues that might lead me to Peter Pettigrew, but nothing seemed to stand out. Then, suddenly, something caught my eye - a small book tucked away in one of the shelves. It was titled \"The Secret Life of Peter Pettigrew\". Could this be what I was looking for? \n",
      "\n",
      "I opened it up and began to read through its pages. It contained detailed information about Peter's life - his family background, his friends and enemies, and even his whereabouts at certain times of day! This could be exactly what I needed! \n",
      "\n",
      "Excitedly, I tucked the book into\n",
