He still loved me...and I was pretty sure I loved him...until now. I knew what I had to do though. Zora knew at least...Penny was still too unsure for her own good. So what will happen next? What is Penny\"s big decision, I think we all know but I\"m not going to simply state it outright! R&R I\"m loving all of the support you guys are giving me with this one. Also...I noticed something the other day, I\"ve been spelling Sid\"s name wrong, it\"s actually Cyd.

He stared dull daggers at me and somehow it still pierced my soul. \"So did I...\" I was still unsure of what I was doing or how I was feeling. \"So...then why are you here? I don\"t understand.\" Billy was still confused. I smiled at him in an attempt to soften his eyes. \"For a scientist, you aren\"t very smart are you?\" I tried to joke, getting up from the desk, meeting up with him in the middle of the room. \"I\"m sorry for lying to you.

I turned to leave, standing in the doorway I looked back at the frozen man one more time. I jumped. Billy was gone I scanned the office as fast as I could...nothing! I spun back around to find Billy standing in front of the doorway. Our eyes locked. I wasn\"t even sure of what to do anymore until Billy took the sides of my face in his palms and kissed me... It was unlike any kiss I\"ve ever had...not that I\"ve kissed a lot but this was like fireworks, like it was meant to be. He shut the door to his office and... My mother raised me to be a lady so I suppose I shouldn\"t share much more. The next morning I woke up in Billy\"s home with him curled up around me. We were bundled up in probably the softest sheets I\"ve ever felt. Billy snores...a lot. It\"s sort of annoying but honestly, I thought it was sort of cute.

      "Billy and I woke up like we normally did; I went downstairs looking for something to eat when I heard a really weird wheezing noise. I looked around and eventually realized it was coming from Moist\"s room. I honestly wasn\"t sure what to do so I got Billy, who was still not totally awake. I led my incredibly sleepy boyfriend downstairs to Moist\"s door. \"What is that noise?\" I asked him; Billy was still trying to adjust to the fact that I had opened the curtains on the windows, letting much more light in the room than he was used to. \"Moist is sick...just let him sit it out. He\"ll get better in a few days. He always makes that noise when he\"s sick. Just sleep with ear plugs, you\"ll be fine.\" Billy started back up the stairs sleepily. \"Oh...okay...sorry I woke you...\" I looked at the door, still kind of creeped out by the noises coming from the door. I didn\"t need to be told twice, I got out of the way and headed for the lab to play The Game. I don\"t really care what anybody says about ethics, I see nothing wrong with using a super villain\"s massive computer with probably the most advanced system I\"ve seen to play a video game. It\"s huge and it never freezes so why not?\n",

I quickly ran upstairs and opened the door to find Moist lying on the floor, coughing and wheezing. He looked like he was in a lot of pain and I knew he needed help. I quickly grabbed my phone and called 911, telling them what had happened. They said they would be there soon and to keep him calm until they arrived.\n",

      "I sat with Moist until the paramedics arrived, trying to keep him as comfortable as possible. He was still coughing and wheezing but he seemed to be getting better with each passing minute. The paramedics took him away in an ambulance and we all watched as it drove away, hoping for the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, Billy and I went back inside and tried to figure out what had happened to Moist. We searched his room for any clues but found nothing out of the ordinary; it seemed like he had just gotten sick out of nowhere. We decided that it must have been something he ate or drank that caused his sudden illness, but we couldn't be sure without further investigation. \n",

      "We decided to call Dr Horrible for help; after all, he was a scientist so maybe he could figure out what had happened to Moist.

      "When Dr Horrible arrived, we were relieved to see him; not only did he bring medical supplies but also a few tests that could help us figure out what had caused Moist's illness in the first place.

I\"m changing their inner cores and plain steel won\"t be able to cut it.\" \"Oh okay.\" I said as I walked away. I remembered I was having lunch with Sid today so I needed to go get dressed. I was ready to leave before Billy was; he was still fumbling with the buttons on his red lab coat. I looked at him and chuckled at his determination. He refused to take his gloves off so the buttons were even smaller by comparison. I watched him for a few minutes before helping him. He sighed in defeat when I had finished the last button.

He explained how it worked and how it could help him in his fight against the ELE. \n",

      "I was amazed by his invention and couldn't believe how far he had come since we first met. We talked for hours about his plans for the future and what he wanted to do with this new technology.

She didn\"t feel right, her head throbbed but more importantly, the scream rang in her ears. City couldn\"t tell how long had passed since she fell to the floor, for some reason she couldn\"t get up, like gravity pounded down on her body. All the pain near her lower stomach seemed ten times stronger than it had after Frank had put it there. She felt so different than she normally had, it was as if she had no strength or energy left. It was at this moment that she finally sat up, propping herself up against her bed. She looked at her legs to discover a strange amount of blood near her legs; it left a stain on the carpet next to her bed.

No amount of sleep would fix it. \"Maybe it would help ever so slightly though...' City thought as she reached the upstairs level of the castle.

Maybe even they would even take his room so she could have a bigger room. The one she currently had was the smallest out of all the rooms in the castle. \"Last one to the party doesn\"t get the best goodie bag\" as Eddie used to say.

She may have been sick to her stomach and tired and bleeding from places she didn\"t know could bleed but she was still curious.

      "Perhaps it was that stupid little Chaplin moustache, on second thought. I never was one for the comedies, and certainly not one to watching that simpering American fool. Only after Hitler had assumed power, I read his belligerent book, My Struggle, and felt oddly enough at that time that his prison sentence wasn\"t enough. Frankly, the man was insane. Yes, Germany was going through difficult times, what with the humiliating treaty we had to sign at the end of World War I, but really, to blame it on a harmless, albeit small, subset of civilians? They weren\"t even the ones who forced us to sign that treaty. Though I could see the overall flaw in the Führer\"s plans, I am not claiming to be a tenderhearted person. Bridget von Hammersmark, as lovely as she was, simply had to die. Did she honestly believe she could slip those I-talians past me without suspicion? Maybe she could have fooled the majority of the crowd, but to believe that she alone would be the sole German receiving credit for Operation Kino, well-I couldn\"t have that. Her death was her own fault. She should have known better than to challenge me. I saw right through her scheme. And mountain climbing, of all activities? How preposterous!\n",

      "After Raine carved his mark-well, I suppose it\"s actually my mark-into my skin, I was transported to Normandy. There I was brought before a rather large presence of Allied soldiers who had only a week ago stormed onto the beaches and suffered massive casualties as well as inflicting quite a lot. I was pushed before them bedecked in my uniform, which by this time had amassed a rather nasty blackish bloodstain on the collar from my freely bleeding forehead. During the trip there, the two remaining Basterds hadn\"t even allowed me the use of my hands to wipe away the blood as it flowed into my eyes and mouth, causing the former to burn almost continually. I figured I\"d be taken into an awaiting aircraft by Raine\"s superiors, but it seems that the only men here are foot soldiers of low status, with no rescue vehicles in sight. As the Allied soldiers moved towards me at Normandy, revenge written across all of their faces, Raine gave me a hard shove towards the sand, soft ground upon which I, dehydrated and hungry, stumbled and fell. I wondered if the hatred I felt emanating from them came from the mere sight of my uniform or in the fact that in knowing what I had done for the Allies, they resented me. In ending the war on the thirteenth, I was a week too late to prevent the deaths of many of their comrades. It was as if their deaths a week ago were in vain, for I was the one to leave the phone on the cradle and to allow for the obliteration of Hitler and the entire Nazi chain of command. But then, in the midst of my thoughts, the tables suddenly turned. \"You\"re the Basterds, ain\"t ya?\" one Allied soldier remarked, referring to Raine and the other surviving Basterd, the man I had cheerfully referred to as the \"Little Man,\" though I was never made aware of his actual name. A big smile was plastered across the soldier\"s youthful face at this introduction. He couldn\"t have been more than eighteen years of age. \"Sure are, kid,\" Raine replied, the tone of his voice making it plain that he was sneering.\n",

You saved us all from certain death.\" I was taken aback by his words and could only manage a weak smile in response. The other Allied soldiers had also gathered around us now, all of them nodding in agreement with the young soldier's words. I felt my cheeks flush with embarrassment as they began to cheer for me, their voices ringing out in unison as they shouted my name. I was overwhelmed by their appreciation and gratitude, and I could only stand there in stunned silence as they continued to cheer for me. It was then that I realized that despite the horrors of war, there was still good in this world; there were still people who were willing to fight for what was right and just. And it was then that I knew that no matter what happened next, I would never forget this moment or the people who had made it possible.\n",

      "Haven\"t had two black eyes since grade school. I think they broke my nose as well, and the carving on my forehead is throbbing unbearably. Pinky finger\"s bent at a strange angle and I have quite a few gashes on my knees as well, but I don\"t really feel those. Surprised I can even manage to write this. June 16, 1944 Raine and some of the Allied soldiers hopped into a military truck and shoved me in the back of it, making me sit back there with several Allied soldiers that glared at me throughout the ride. I didn\"t say very much, because it\"s not going to make very much difference. I figured by this point I\"d be on a ship headed for America with Allied soldiers that treated me with resentment and respect both. Instead, I\"m bloodied and sore in the back of a military vehicle with people who hate me. I began to feel more and more that this proof of my treachery, this \"recorded\" audio, did not actually exist. Additionally, I heard more about the happenings in the theater between the military men, many who didn\"t realize my excellent command of the English language. Evidently, all parties involved are claiming that Emmanuelle - the owner of the theater - was at least partly responsible for the massive fire, being as there would be no reason to leave nitrate film lying about on stage in large quantities otherwise; the material was known to be highly flammable. The Basterds received their fair due for their role in the fall of the Reich. The Bear Jew and his I-talian companion were to receive posthumous Medals of Honor.

I, on the other hand, was pushed right through into my sentencing. The sentence being death, of course. I am told that I should be executed several times over. Death for committing countless atrocities against countless innocents. Death for betraying Germany. I suppose one could argue that this is a fair sentence. Upon their receiving the tape and myself from Lt. Raine, the new leaders of Germany remind me again and again that I have shamed my country, that I have shamed humankind. That I am nothing more than an inglorious bastard, and that I deserve to die. I wouldn\"t necessarily disagree with them.\n",

      "Amy stood up as she adjusted her skirt and underclothes, watching Sheldon quickly cross his legs. She bit her lip as he looked up at her, his face oddly pale and yet dotted with sweat. \"Here is the riding crop,\" he said, picking it up from beside him and handing it to her. \"You should put it away now.\" \"Okay,\" she said, proceeding to her room. Sheldon looked down to see the primal response of his body to the situation and stood up, zipping up his windbreaker and pulling it down as far as it would stretch. This was only the second time his body had responded to Amy in this way, the first time being her Star Trek doctor play. Perhaps this sensation was not all bad. If this was congruent to how Amy was feeling, then it was no wonder that she enjoyed the situation that had elicited it. Kohlinar didn\"t seem appropriate at the moment, in the wake of such purely physical sensations. Yes, theirs would be a mutualistic relationship... perhaps less train museum visits would be required, in light of this new benefit for him.

      "Sparing the specific details, I may add that they did indeed get to know each other much better that night, with Maygent proposing that he would soon be divorcing his wife for Janita. A sad fate for his three children, but with Janita perhaps becoming his second wife, they would better cope. Of course you are all thinking, how could something like that have happened so fast? The only way I can respond to this is that, this sort of thing happens every day, but apparently not to you disbelievers. The memory of Jim within Janita\"s mind was flushed completely away, for this sexual experience had aided her in realizing something about her chaste fiancé of six years. Jim, in his bedroom a few doors down from Frenkie\"s bedroom suite, could only stare at the ceiling in expectations of a midnight visit. However, this midnight visit, he hoped, would not be from his fiancée or from Maria, the groupie with a heart of gold; this visit, he prayed, would be from the man himself, Frenk M. Curry. No sooner had his thoughts bounced about in his head with the dozen chimes of the grandfather clock, than his bedroom door groaned softly and a lean figure stood at the entrance, shadowed by the intense light of the hallway. First, of course, he had to be certain that if it was indeed Janita, that his cover was not blown. \"Is that you, Janita?\" he spoke at the figure, crossing his fingers beneath the satin sheets that he was wrong. \"As a matter of fact, it is not,\" the deep male voice answered in a hesitant British accent. He approached Jim\"s bed slowly, almost timidly. \"Who is it then?\" Jim asked, feeling chills run down his spine.\n",

      "Frenkie smiled and stepped closer to the bed. \"I'm here to offer you a proposition,\" he said. \"I know that Janita has feelings for you, and I want to make sure that she is happy.\" He paused for a moment before continuing. \"If you agree to marry her, I will give you a generous sum of money and provide for her needs.\" Jim was taken aback by the offer, but he knew that it was too good to pass up. He agreed to Frenkie's proposal and thanked him for his generosity. \n",

The next morning, when Janita awoke, she found a note from Frenkie on her pillow informing her of their arrangement and wishing them both luck in their new life together. She was overjoyed at the news and couldn't wait to tell Jim about it!\n",

      "Perhaps it was that stupid little Chaplin moustache, on second thought. I never was one for the comedies, and certainly not one to watching that simpering American fool. Only after Hitler had assumed power, I read his belligerent book, My Struggle, and felt oddly enough at that time that his prison sentence wasn\"t enough. Frankly, the man was insane. Yes, Germany was going through difficult times, what with the humiliating treaty we had to sign at the end of World War I, but really, to blame it on a harmless, albeit small, subset of civilians? They weren\"t even the ones who forced us to sign that treaty. Though I could see the overall flaw in the Führer\"s plans, I am not claiming to be a tenderhearted person. Bridget von Hammersmark, as lovely as she was, simply had to die. Did she honestly believe she could slip those I-talians past me without suspicion? Maybe she could have fooled the majority of the crowd, but to believe that she alone would be the sole German receiving credit for Operation Kino, well-I couldn\"t have that. Her death was her own fault. She should have known better than to challenge me. I saw right through her scheme. And mountain climbing, of all activities? How preposterous!\n",

      "After Raine carved his mark-well, I suppose it\"s actually my mark-into my skin, I was transported to Normandy. There I was brought before a rather large presence of Allied soldiers who had only a week ago stormed onto the beaches and suffered massive casualties as well as inflicting quite a lot. I was pushed before them bedecked in my uniform, which by this time had amassed a rather nasty blackish bloodstain on the collar from my freely bleeding forehead. During the trip there, the two remaining Basterds hadn\"t even allowed me the use of my hands to wipe away the blood as it flowed into my eyes and mouth, causing the former to burn almost continually. I figured I\"d be taken into an awaiting aircraft by Raine\"s superiors, but it seems that the only men here are foot soldiers of low status, with no rescue vehicles in sight. As the Allied soldiers moved towards me at Normandy, revenge written across all of their faces, Raine gave me a hard shove towards the sand, soft ground upon which I, dehydrated and hungry, stumbled and fell. I wondered if the hatred I felt emanating from them came from the mere sight of my uniform or in the fact that in knowing what I had done for the Allies, they resented me. In ending the war on the thirteenth, I was a week too late to prevent the deaths of many of their comrades. It was as if their deaths a week ago were in vain, for I was the one to leave the phone on the cradle and to allow for the obliteration of Hitler and the entire Nazi chain of command. But then, in the midst of my thoughts, the tables suddenly turned. \"You\"re the Basterds, ain\"t ya?\" one Allied soldier remarked, referring to Raine and the other surviving Basterd, the man I had cheerfully referred to as the \"Little Man,\" though I was never made aware of his actual name. A big smile was plastered across the soldier\"s youthful face at this introduction. He couldn\"t have been more than eighteen years of age. \"Sure are, kid,\" Raine replied, the tone of his voice making it plain that he was sneering.\n",

I was no longer the enemy; I was one of them. The soldier then turned to me and extended his hand once more. \"Welcome to Normandy,\" he said with a smile. I shook his hand, feeling a sense of relief wash over me as I realized that my mission had been successful and that I had been accepted by my former enemies. \n",

      "The Allied soldiers then began to disperse, leaving Raine and the Little Man standing beside me in the sand. Raine looked at me with an expression of pride before turning away and walking off without another word. The Little Man followed suit, leaving me alone in Normandy with nothing but my thoughts for company. As I watched them walk away, I couldn\"t help but feel a sense of accomplishment for having completed my mission and for having earned the respect of those who had once despised me.\n",

Pinky finger\"s bent at a strange angle and I have quite a few gashes on my knees as well, but I don\"t really feel those. Surprised I can even manage to write this. June 16, 1944 Raine and some of the Allied soldiers hopped into a military truck and shoved me in the back of it, making me sit back there with several Allied soldiers that glared at me throughout the ride. I didn\"t say very much, because it\"s not going to make very much difference. I figured by this point I\"d be on a ship headed for America with Allied soldiers that treated me with resentment and respect both. Instead, I\"m bloodied and sore in the back of a military vehicle with people who hate me. I began to feel more and more that this proof of my treachery, this \"recorded\" audio, did not actually exist. Additionally, I heard more about the happenings in the theater between the military men, many who didn\"t realize my excellent command of the English language. Evidently, all parties involved are claiming that Emmanuelle - the owner of the theater - was at least partly responsible for the massive fire, being as there would be no reason to leave nitrate film lying about on stage in large quantities otherwise; the material was known to be highly flammable. The Basterds received their fair due for their role in the fall of the Reich. The Bear Jew and his I-talian companion were to receive posthumous Medals of Honor.

This was probably my twentieth attempt at mentioning the deal that had been made that fateful night.\n",

I never considered that something could have happened to the man I had spoken to over the radio. The recording didn\"t exist, of that I was sure. But now Raine had no reason to follow through on any of the conditions of my agreement with his commanding officer. I sat in the back of the truck, lazily reading fliers mounted to poles that we had passed on our way through Germany, holding on to the hope that with no real proof of my treachery, he\"d decide against turning me in.

Each one have different reaction to it. Lady Pepper and Lady Natasha gives me their blessings to court their friend and were happy that someone actually deeply cares for Lady Alexandra. Steve really likes the idea of being a couple and told me if something happens to her by my fault, he will fight me. Bruce and Clint have similar responses as Steve. Not wanting to have more attention about my announcement, my mind wanders somewhere else. What should I do to ask her to court me? I want to make her comfortable with using the Midgardian traditions, but I still wish to it my way. Maybe asking some of the male\"s what I should do.

He didn\"t speak when he came in, just took of his shoes and his jacket, and then perched at the table in the corner, pouring over blue prints from his latest conquest. Harley didn\"t have the strength to speak; to question him. She didn\"t dare to bring up the argument that had separated them, or to mention Poison Ivy. She needn\"t have worried though, because before long she didn\"t need to. She\"d fallen asleep. She woke to the feel of his fingers dancing on her cheek. Through sleepy eyes, she smiled, realising that he had pulled the covers up around her as she\"d slept. He laid beside her, resting on his elbow and watching her. \"You know it\"s not about the socks,\" he said, his lips smacking and his tongue darting out nervously. Harley wriggled and freed her own hand, bringing it to rest on top of his. \"I did wonder,\" she murmured, turning her head to lightly kiss his fingers.\n",

He nodded, and then leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \"But I\"m still Batman,\" he said, his lips brushing against her skin as he spoke. Harley smiled again, and then snuggled closer to him. She knew that no matter what happened between them, he would always be Batman; the hero of Gotham City. \n",

      "He pulled away from her slightly, and then reached into his pocket to pull out a small box. He opened it slowly, revealing a beautiful diamond ring nestled inside. His eyes were bright as he looked at her expectantly; waiting for an answer to the question that had been on his mind for months now. Harley gasped in surprise before nodding eagerly; tears of joy streaming down her face as she accepted his proposal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The plane began to descend slowly as they embraced each other tightly; their love stronger than ever before. As they touched down on the ground below them, they both knew that this was only the beginning of their journey together; one that would take them through many more adventures in Gotham City as Batman and Catwoman - two heroes who were destined to be together forevermore.\n",

I gave up my old life, Jack. Ours are intertwined now.\" All of a sudden, the air became cold. Harley found herself crushed against the metal bed stead, the cold steel of his knife against her bottom lip and the full weight of his body pressed against hers. \"I didn\"t ask for you,\" he spat, watching her gasp for breath. He held back after a while; he didn\"t want to actually suffocate her. Soon, Harley\"s breathing went back to normal, and she was able to speak. \"I know you didn\"t,\" she whispered. \"But you wanted me to come, didn\"t you?\" He didn\"t answer, and the blade still pressed against her skin.

She shuddered when his voice changed, when it became inhuman, almost like a bark or a roar. He sat down on the bed and reached out, grabbing hold of her with one arm and pulling her close to him. His spare hand curled around the fabric of her shirt and tore it away. Harley gasped, and tried desperately not to squeal. Her bra was exposed, and he ran his rough fingers over the silvery \"J\" engraved on her breast. \"So perfectly broken,\" he mumbled, his eyes raking over her entire body. \"So small, so easy to snap,\" his hands had come to rest on her neck, and Harley felt herself swallow heavily. \"But I can\"t, because if I did, I wouldn\"t be able to have you.

      "\"Tell me you need me,\" she said, gazing into his eyes. He looked even more afraid than she was when he answered; \"I need you,\" Harley didn\"t wait for anything else, and smashed her lips against his with all the force she had. For a moment, it seemed he wasn\"t going to respond but then he took hold of either side of her head and pushed her down onto the bed, their lips never breaking contact. Harley tore at the buttons of his vest and he wrenched open her jeans. His fingers groped at her clumsily, but Harley could wait for him to calm down enough to focus on what he was doing. She\"d gotten his vest off and tugged at his tie, loosening it quickly and unbuttoning his shirt until finally she was able to run her nails over the smooth skin beneath. He had scars from a life full of beatings, but the skin of his chest was clear enough. Harley bent her head to press kisses onto his skin, and as she did his furious onslaught on her slowed. Harley gasped when his aim suddenly hit the spot and his fingers were inside her in the best way. His thumb rubbed her in expert circles, and for a moment she forgot everything that had happened and moaned in delight, lifting her hips to get closer to his touch. Harley whimpered in protest when his hand left her underwear, but she smiled when she felt the insisted tug of her jeans being pulled down over her hips. She did her best to help the situation and wriggled out of them, shivering from the sudden rush of cold when she realised her underwear had gone too. He soon warmed her up, and Harley opened her eyes to see his above her. She reached up and held his face with her hands, smirking when his makeup smudged under her fingers. She knew she must have plenty of it on her face already.\n",

He moved his lips to her neck and Harley gasped as he bit down gently, sending shivers through her body. His hands moved lower, exploring every inch of her body until he reached the apex of her thighs.

The Joker spun around, his arms held out wide, oblivious to the weapons pointed at his head. \"I gotta get out of here,\" he corrected, glaring at her. \"You\"re an ungrateful little pincushion aren\"t you?\" \"Get down on the damn floor you asshole!\" Gordon yelled, his gun drawn and directed at the clown in his interrogation room. \"NOW!\" \"Do you mind commissioner, we\"re kinda having a moment here,\" \"To hell with it, Joker, I don\"t have time for your games. Get down on the floor or I\"ll shoot!\" Harley leapt in front of her lover, shielding him from the commissioner; \"No way, I didn\"t stop him killing you so you could blow him to hell,\" \"Oh, he\"s not going to hurt me Harley baby,\" the Joker sneered, and grabbed her around the waist pulling her tight against him.\n",

Harley dropped down onto the bed, more from exhaustion than anything else. The last forty eight hours had been a blur, and she hadn\"t slept much. He didn\"t speak when he came in, just took of his shoes and his jacket, and then perched at the table in the corner, pouring over blue prints from his latest conquest. Harley didn\"t have the strength to speak; to question him. She didn\"t dare to bring up the argument that had separated them, or to mention Poison Ivy. She needn\"t have worried though, because before long she didn\"t need to. She\"d fallen asleep. She woke to the feel of his fingers dancing on her cheek. Through sleepy eyes, she smiled, realising that he had pulled the covers up around her as she\"d slept. He laid beside her, resting on his elbow and watching her. \"You know it\"s not about the socks,\" he said, his lips smacking and his tongue darting out nervously. Harley wriggled and freed her own hand, bringing it to rest on top of his. \"I did wonder,\" she murmured, turning her head to lightly kiss his fingers.\n",

He nodded, and then leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \"But I\"m still Batman,\" he said, his lips brushing against her skin as he spoke. Harley smiled again, and then snuggled closer to him. She knew that no matter what happened between them, he would always be Batman; the hero of Gotham City. \n",

I gave up my old life, Jack. Ours are intertwined now.\" All of a sudden, the air became cold. Harley found herself crushed against the metal bed stead, the cold steel of his knife against her bottom lip and the full weight of his body pressed against hers. \"I didn\"t ask for you,\" he spat, watching her gasp for breath.

She shuddered when his voice changed, when it became inhuman, almost like a bark or a roar. He sat down on the bed and reached out, grabbing hold of her with one arm and pulling her close to him. His spare hand curled around the fabric of her shirt and tore it away. Harley gasped, and tried desperately not to squeal. Her bra was exposed, and he ran his rough fingers over the silvery \"J\" engraved on her breast. \"So perfectly broken,\" he mumbled, his eyes raking over her entire body. \"So small, so easy to snap,\" his hands had come to rest on her neck, and Harley felt herself swallow heavily. \"But I can\"t, because if I did, I wouldn\"t be able to have you.

He looked even more afraid than she was when he answered; \"I need you,\" Harley didn\"t wait for anything else, and smashed her lips against his with all the force she had. For a moment, it seemed he wasn\"t going to respond but then he took hold of either side of her head and pushed her down onto the bed, their lips never breaking contact. Harley tore at the buttons of his vest and he wrenched open her jeans. His fingers groped at her clumsily, but Harley could wait for him to calm down enough to focus on what he was doing. She\"d gotten his vest off and tugged at his tie, loosening it quickly and unbuttoning his shirt until finally she was able to run her nails over the smooth skin beneath. He had scars from a life full of beatings, but the skin of his chest was clear enough. Harley bent her head to press kisses onto his skin, and as she did his furious onslaught on her slowed. Harley gasped when his aim suddenly hit the spot and his fingers were inside her in the best way. His thumb rubbed her in expert circles, and for a moment she forgot everything that had happened and moaned in delight, lifting her hips to get closer to his touch. Harley whimpered in protest when his hand left her underwear, but she smiled when she felt the insisted tug of her jeans being pulled down over her hips. She did her best to help the situation and wriggled out of them, shivering from the sudden rush of cold when she realised her underwear had gone too. He soon warmed her up, and Harley opened her eyes to see his above her. She reached up and held his face with her hands, smirking when his makeup smudged under her fingers.

His hands had just reached hers when Harley lost it completely, she tore her hands away and jumped back away from him. \"NO!\" she screeched, as manically as he could have done. \"Get the hell away from me!\" \"You heard the lady, Joker,\" Foolish, foolish Gordon choked from the floor. The Joker\"s eyes clouded and his eyes narrowed in annoyance. He did not want Gordon interfering with his private life. That was not funny. He grabbed the lapels of the commissioner\"s jacket and lifted him off the ground with unnatural ease. Gordon was not deterred. \"Leave Ms Quinzel alone; she\"s not coming with you.\" The Joker roared with anger and brought Gordon slamming down onto the interrogation table in seconds.

Get down on the floor or I\"ll shoot!\" Harley leapt in front of her lover, shielding him from the commissioner; \"No way, I didn\"t stop him killing you so you could blow him to hell,\" \"Oh, he\"s not going to hurt me Harley baby,\" the Joker sneered, and grabbed her around the waist pulling her tight against him.\n",

Harley dropped down onto the bed, more from exhaustion than anything else. The last forty eight hours had been a blur, and she hadn\"t slept much. He didn\"t speak when he came in, just took of his shoes and his jacket, and then perched at the table in the corner, pouring over blue prints from his latest conquest. Harley didn\"t have the strength to speak; to question him. She didn\"t dare to bring up the argument that had separated them, or to mention Poison Ivy. She needn\"t have worried though, because before long she didn\"t need to. She\"d fallen asleep. She woke to the feel of his fingers dancing on her cheek. Through sleepy eyes, she smiled, realising that he had pulled the covers up around her as she\"d slept. He laid beside her, resting on his elbow and watching her. \"You know it\"s not about the socks,\" he said, his lips smacking and his tongue darting out nervously. Harley wriggled and freed her own hand, bringing it to rest on top of his. \"I did wonder,\" she murmured, turning her head to lightly kiss his fingers.\n",

He nodded, and then leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \"But I\"m still Batman,\" he said, his lips brushing against her skin as he spoke. Harley smiled again, and then snuggled closer to him. She knew that no matter what happened between them, he would always be Batman; the hero of Gotham City. \n",

I gave up my old life, Jack. Ours are intertwined now.\" All of a sudden, the air became cold.

She shuddered when his voice changed, when it became inhuman, almost like a bark or a roar. He sat down on the bed and reached out, grabbing hold of her with one arm and pulling her close to him. His spare hand curled around the fabric of her shirt and tore it away. Harley gasped, and tried desperately not to squeal. Her bra was exposed, and he ran his rough fingers over the silvery \"J\" engraved on her breast. \"So perfectly broken,\" he mumbled, his eyes raking over her entire body. \"So small, so easy to snap,\" his hands had come to rest on her neck, and Harley felt herself swallow heavily. \"But I can\"t, because if I did, I wouldn\"t be able to have you.

He looked even more afraid than she was when he answered; \"I need you,\" Harley didn\"t wait for anything else, and smashed her lips against his with all the force she had. For a moment, it seemed he wasn\"t going to respond but then he took hold of either side of her head and pushed her down onto the bed, their lips never breaking contact. Harley tore at the buttons of his vest and he wrenched open her jeans. His fingers groped at her clumsily, but Harley could wait for him to calm down enough to focus on what he was doing. She\"d gotten his vest off and tugged at his tie, loosening it quickly and unbuttoning his shirt until finally she was able to run her nails over the smooth skin beneath. He had scars from a life full of beatings, but the skin of his chest was clear enough. Harley bent her head to press kisses onto his skin, and as she did his furious onslaught on her slowed. Harley gasped when his aim suddenly hit the spot and his fingers were inside her in the best way. His thumb rubbed her in expert circles, and for a moment she forgot everything that had happened and moaned in delight, lifting her hips to get closer to his touch. Harley whimpered in protest when his hand left her underwear, but she smiled when she felt the insisted tug of her jeans being pulled down over her hips. She did her best to help the situation and wriggled out of them, shivering from the sudden rush of cold when she realised her underwear had gone too. He soon warmed her up, and Harley opened her eyes to see his above her. She reached up and held his face with her hands, smirking when his makeup smudged under her fingers.

Then, just as slowly, Bender let his hand drop under the table, where his fingers began to trace ever so delicate circles on her exposed knee. Claire felt her breath catch in her throat and hoped he hadn\"t heard it. He had. That tiny sound reminded Bender who he was dealing with. A girl so pure, so pristine, that the touch of his fingers on her skin was enough to provoke a response. He turned his face to look at her, and saw she still had her face toward the front of the room. But her eyes were cast down, her breathing low and careful. Gently, he moved his fingers northwards only slightly, so that he was now tracing circles on her thigh. Finally, she turned her face toward him and looked into his eyes. Nothing could have prepared Bender for the impact of that look. His first response would have been to move his hand further, but he knew she wouldn\"t allow it, no matter how good it felt. He knew this, and didn\"t move his hand, because he couldn\"t face not touching her. He felt like all of his internal organs had knotted up inside of him.\n",

      "Claire had expected him to leap up and vandalise something at least. He just stared at the closed door. She reached under the table for his hand and covered it with hers so that his palm was flat against her thigh. Now it was his turn for a sharp intake of breath as his fingers were pressed into the flesh that he wanted more than anything. He turned to look at her again, and met her eyes. She saw something strange in them that she had never seen in any eyes before, and she didn\"t know exactly what it was. If she had looked into his eyes just after they kissed last week she would have seen something similar, but she hadn\"t. Now it had had a week to grow in intensity, and what she saw was so unfamiliar that it scared her. \"What is it?\" She asked, her voice no louder than a whisper. Bender swallowed heavily, his eyes flickering down to her lips and back up to her eyes. \"What the hell have you done to me?\" He said, a look of total disbelief on his face. He felt something surging through his veins that made his whole body ache, and he had no idea what was happening to him. He\"d looked at girls before, at close proximity and felt something... usually in his pants, but this was totally unfamiliar and alien to him. Claire didn\"t say anything.\n",

She couldn\"t work out what he was saying but it made her tremble every time. She shifted in her seat and shuddered when she felt the fabric of his long grey coat against her skin from where he had draped it over the chair next to her. That was the point when she began fantasising about telling her friends to back off and let her make her own choices; when she started to wonder what it would be like to kiss John Bender goodnight, and wake up in his arms; when she started to wonder what it would be like to fall in love with him. She knew it was foolish of course. She knew it could never happen because he didn\"t believe in one guy-one girl, and he wasn\"t about to change his lifestyle for her. She realised that she would be willing to give up more than she had ever thought possible to be with him, but she couldn\"t count on him feeling the same. He couldn\"t feel the same. He was John Bender. But then again, who was she to judge him? Wasn\"t that what their Breakfast Club was all about? She had been seeing things so much clearer since that Saturday, and she liked it that way. It made her feel good, like a better person. When Vernon came back into the room, Bender and Jaynee were back in their seats and Jaynee had managed to jot down something that made Vernon smirk when he read it, before telling her he expected her back next week.\n",

She got closer to him and he took the cigarette out of his mouth and blew the smoke out to the side of him to avoid her.

Just - just -\" he was approaching, getting closer and closer, the tails of his purple coat brushing over the barely conscious form Gordon as he stepped over him towards her. His hands had just reached hers when Harley lost it completely, she tore her hands away and jumped back away from him. \"NO!\" she screeched, as manically as he could have done. \"Get the hell away from me!\" \"You heard the lady, Joker,\" Foolish, foolish Gordon choked from the floor. The Joker\"s eyes clouded and his eyes narrowed in annoyance. He did not want Gordon interfering with his private life. That was not funny. He grabbed the lapels of the commissioner\"s jacket and lifted him off the ground with unnatural ease. Gordon was not deterred. \"Leave Ms Quinzel alone; she\"s not coming with you.\" The Joker roared with anger and brought Gordon slamming down onto the interrogation table in seconds. The commissioner spluttered and gasped; all the wind had been knocked out of him.\n",

The Joker spun around, his arms held out wide, oblivious to the weapons pointed at his head. \"I gotta get out of here,\" he corrected, glaring at her. \"You\"re an ungrateful little pincushion aren\"t you?\" \"Get down on the damn floor you asshole!\" Gordon yelled, his gun drawn and directed at the clown in his interrogation room. \"NOW!\" \"Do you mind commissioner, we\"re kinda having a moment here,\" \"To hell with it, Joker, I don\"t have time for your games.

The GPD building shrunk quickly, and soon enough they were inside a rather rickety old plane. Harley dropped down onto the bed, more from exhaustion than anything else. The last forty eight hours had been a blur, and she hadn\"t slept much. He didn\"t speak when he came in, just took of his shoes and his jacket, and then perched at the table in the corner, pouring over blue prints from his latest conquest. Harley didn\"t have the strength to speak; to question him. She didn\"t dare to bring up the argument that had separated them, or to mention Poison Ivy. She needn\"t have worried though, because before long she didn\"t need to. She\"d fallen asleep. She woke to the feel of his fingers dancing on her cheek. Through sleepy eyes, she smiled, realising that he had pulled the covers up around her as she\"d slept. He laid beside her, resting on his elbow and watching her. \"You know it\"s not about the socks,\" he said, his lips smacking and his tongue darting out nervously.

I may not be as wanted as you, but they still want me off the streets. I gave up my old life, Jack. Ours are intertwined now.\" All of a sudden, the air became cold.

His face was animated; his eyes more alive than she had ever seen them. She shuddered when his voice changed, when it became inhuman, almost like a bark or a roar. He sat down on the bed and reached out, grabbing hold of her with one arm and pulling her close to him. His spare hand curled around the fabric of her shirt and tore it away. Harley gasped, and tried desperately not to squeal. Her bra was exposed, and he ran his rough fingers over the silvery \"J\" engraved on her breast. \"So perfectly broken,\" he mumbled, his eyes raking over her entire body. \"So small, so easy to snap,\" his hands had come to rest on her neck, and Harley felt herself swallow heavily. \"But I can\"t, because if I did, I wouldn\"t be able to have you.

For a moment, it seemed he wasn\"t going to respond but then he took hold of either side of her head and pushed her down onto the bed, their lips never breaking contact.

His thumb rubbed her in expert circles, and for a moment she forgot everything that had happened and moaned in delight, lifting her hips to get closer to his touch.

      "are we going to do?\" Natasha asked. \"Her behavior is worser than I thought,\" Father George sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, \"if she continues to be in denial, a death will occur.\" \"How can you be sure?\" Pepper asked, worried for her friend. \"I have been on Alexandra\"s side for many years trying to keep positivity around her because she has a \"curse\" on her.\" \"What kind of curse?\" Bruce asked, catching his attention. \"She lost her biological parents at the age of three, making her an orphan. Jane\"s parents adopted her and made her life like hell\n",
      "until she was thirteen years old. Before Loki, everyone will say that she\"s so ugly and other unnessorites words. Basically when times seem to be positive, there\"s always some sort of negativity.\" \"Whoa,\" Clint speaks with widen eyes. \"Listen here Alexandra! There\"s nothing wrong with me and if you and the others continue.....you know what I don\"t want to be your sister anymore!\" Jane\"s screaming made everyone to see the screen. Alexandra sat there stunned as Jane storms off. Loki watches in fear to see his beloved princess about to break down. Thor feels his blood boiling inside, seeing this.\n",
      "*Alexandra\"s POV* Even well into the evening hours, the statement that Jane said is still fresh. I lost the last of my family because of that house. My nerves are shaking. Even though I have cried over things like this, tears will not come out. Am I in shock? I am drinking some iced water while staring out New York City through the some large windows. The city became home since I was eighteen years old when I joined the team. Friends with people that I would never have thought I will become friends with. Especially with Thor and Loki.\n",
      "SInce childhood my knowledge of Norse mythology grew and grew, not knowing why. Now I know why, but still.... Will my life be better in Asgard? Or should I stay in Midgard hoping for the best? I am so confused! \"Lady Alexandra?\" Turning around, Thor and Loki stand there staring back. \"We were speaking with the team and we all agreed on something,\" Thor speaks up. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Everyone believes that you life will be better if you come with us to Asgard,\" Loki explains. I dropped my drink and it shattered at my feet. \"What?\" I\n",
      "asked in shock. \"The end of Loki\"s punishment is growing near, so his fate will be named,\" Thor explained. \"Rather I get sentenced to death or the throne,\" Loki says softly, approaching towards me to hold hands with me, \"Brother Thor and I will make sure you will become an immortal citizen of Asgard.\" My eyebrows raise up at the new name for Thor. The corners of my lips curl up as I feel a few tears fall down. I nodded my head, accepting the offer. Loki smiles big, pecking my lips and hugs me tightly. Thor joins in the\n",
      "hug, holding his siblings close. Chapter 22: *No One\"s POV* \"Do you really have to leave?\" Alexandra asked crying in her immortal lover\"s arms. \"I have to,\" he answers sadly, hugging her tight. \"But what if I don\"t see you again?\" \"Don\"t say such words,\" he says, making her face him, \"we are still going to be together one way or another, even it means I will make war.\" \"I love you so much Prince Loki Laufeyson of Asgard.\" \"I love you so much more Alexandra Raymond-Foster of Midgard.\" He pulls her into a long kiss and slowly pulling away.\n",
      "Lyrics of their Midgardian love song whispers through his lips to her as she slowly smiles to him. \"We must be leaving now,\" Thor says sadly, walking up next to his brother. Loki still has his arms around Alexandra while slowly moving up to teleporting up to the sky. Her arms raises up to her lover until she couldn\"t see her lover and/or best friend/brother. More tears run down her face as she falls down to her knees on the grassy grounds. No matter how much she doesn\"t want to think about it, that could be the last time she\n",
      "will see her soulmate. Loki\"s her everything to first kiss, boyfriend, love, everything. The Adam to her Eve, Romeo to Juliet. A hand gently drops on her shoulder. She looks up to see her good friend Clint aka Hawkeye staring down to her with sadness in his eyes as well. He kneels down to hug her as she cries her doe like eyes out. \"Don\"t think that you will never going to see Loki again,\" he whispers to her softly, stroking her hair, \"you are going to see him again and he will make sure that your life will be\n",
      "better.\" She hugs him tighter for comfort. *Later that night* Alexandra didn\"t want to sleep that night, but she knew she has to because she wouldn\"t focus on time. A green tank top with black sweats clothed her body as she gets into bed. Loki\"s side feels cold, colder than his powers, not the familiar warmth coming from his body. Teary eyes look at the side as she slowly falls asleep. All of sudden, her head starts to feel weird. Hurting yet feeling dizzy even though she\"s laying down on her side. Deep breaths are made as she\"s having trouble\n",
      "of breathing. \"What\"s going on?' she asked to herself, opening her eyes in a panic. Before she can call out for help to JAVIS, she suddenly falls unconsciousness. *Asgard* Loki Laufeyson has chains on his wrists and ankles as he is in the palace dungeons. He\"s been here for hours to the point she doesn\"t know if it\"s still day or night. Fingertips touch the emerald on the golden chain that hangs around his neck. The princess of his dreams keep his spirits up. Visions of their future together appear before his eyes. Alexandra becoming one with Loki as king\n",
      "and queen of Asgard. Not only that, they become parents of a little heir and a little heiress. A single tear escapes his eye. Loki really hopes that he gets the throne not only for him, but also for Alexandra. Even though Thor is willing to help her as well, he wants to give her a better life because she deserves it more then anything. Suddenly, two palace guards approach the energy force door. No words spoke, just stares. They open the door and grab the chains, pulling the God of Mischief up the stairs towards the throne room. The\n",
      "throne room only has King Odin and Thor. His brother looks over his shoulder towards him. He too is worried and concerned for Loki\"s fate. Loki steps forward when the chains are removed from the guards. King Odin orders them away so he talk to his sons in secret. \"Thor,\" his mighty voice speaks, \"tell me Loki\"s behavior in Midgard.\" \"His behavior changed from bad to good,\" the God of Thunder replies to his father, \"he has learned to give others respect, helped others and most importantly, Loki fell in love with a mortal female.\" \"Loki,\" he speaks, making him\n",
      "to look up, \"please tell me about this mortal female that you have romantic feelings for.\" \"Her name is Alexandra,\" he answers softly, \"a young Midgardian female born with Asgardian beauty.\" This caught the All-Father\"s interest. \"She understands me more then anyone could because her past is simular to mine. Selfless, beautiful, intelligent, prefers the simpler life similar to Asgard. Her favorite forms of entertainment sparks my interests in reading, enjoying time together, and some of Midgardian entertainment.\" He touches the necklace once again. \"She has given me this as a gift for a tradition in Midgardian holiday called Christmas.\"\n",
      "He smiles softly, thinking of her then frowns sadly, \"No matter how much she tries to be good and protects Midgard with her magical powers, horrible things will continue on to take her down. She sees good in many thing that no one sees. She\"s Alexandra, Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" His majesty, the king, watches his youngest son describe this Goddess of Hidden Beauty. Such emotion and passion also love in his eyes. Loki is truly indeed in love. \"Loki,\" he finally speaks then smiles, \"you are next in line for the throne.\" Both brothers stare at their father stunned.\n",
      "\"Your mother had visions of a female from Midgard and always believe that you and her are meant to be. She kept in secrecy because she wanted you to fall in love wit her without knowing her.\" \"Father....\" Thor and Loki were speechless to hear this. \"You will take the throne as king along with your lady as queen. Now go inform Alexandra in Midgard. Also I would like to meet the Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" \"Thank you Father,\" Loki smiles big to him. \"You are welcome King Loki,\" he smiles back. Thor and Loki leaves the throne room still\n",
      "stunned of what just happened. \"Congratulations Brother,\" Thor grins, pulling him into a hug. \"Is this for real Brother?\" Loki feels speechless. \"It is real Loki!\" he looks at him with his hands on his shoulders. \"You and Lady Alexandra are becoming King and Queen of Asgard!\" \"That\"s only if she accepts,\" Loki noted. \"She will accept. Now come on, let\" go and inform her!\" The grins appears on Loki\"s face again as they teleport to Midgard. Chapter 23: *No One\"s POV* *Midgard* For some odd reason, the gods were pulled to another location instead of the Tower. Then they\n",
      "step foot on the Earthly grounds, a horrible sight greeted them. Alexandra\"s childhood home is on fire! Flames are over twenty feet tall, covering almost every inch of the structure. Midgardian firefighters try to put out the fire when they see Tony in his Ironman suit flying around in a panic. \"Man of Iron!\" Thor calls for his teammate. \"Huh?\" Tony says confused, but notices the Asgardians on the ground. \"Thor! Reindeer Games!\" he calls back, flying down to them. Loki growls under his breath at the nickname. \"First of all, it has been a week since we last saw\n",
      "you two,\" Tony explained, \"and this week has gone bad to worse.\" \"Where are Lady Alexandra and Lady Jane?\" Loki asked, getting seriously worried. \"Alexandra has been in the hospital since the first night and we just got Jane into the hospital.\" \"What happened?!\" Thor asked, freaking out. \"Follow me and I will show you.\" The hospital is in the middle of the city and it\"s waiting room is filled with the team. You can see in their eyes that they\"re happy t see the Asgardian gods, but the happiness disappear due to the current situation. \"I am looking for\n",
      "the boyfriends of both Jane Foster and Alexandra Raymond-Foster,\" a head doctor asked, approaching the team. \"We are them,\" Thor speaks for them. \"Is Alexandra alright?\" Loki asked, softly, really concerned. \"Please come with me,\" the doctor says, walking back to where he was. Thor and Loki quickly follows him. He leads them to a room that has a curtain separating them from someone. It opens to reveal a sight that startles them gratefully. A female looking for wearing some clothing that\"s burned off and barely covering the nessoristy areas. Skin colored in deep red and hair is missing. The\n",
      "look in the female\"s eyes is filled with pure pain. \"Jane Foster,\" the doctor says to the gods, letting them approach her. The God of Thunder slowly walks to her side in disbelief. \"What happened to her?\" Loki asked the doctor. \"She was at the source of the fire in the home resulting her into untreatable bruns.\" \"You don\"t mean....\" \"I\"m afraid so. We are doing the best we could for now. Now let me show you Alexandra. Jane needs to focus on staying awake and breathing on her own.\" His brother slowly removes himself from Jane\"s room to follow\n",
      "Loki and the doctor. \"Take care of my sister,' The God of Mischief hears the mortal female speak to him through his mind. \"I will,' he responded through his mind. Doctor leads them to a far location of the hospital. THe long walk is making Loki more worried for his one true love. Thor has mixed emotions running through his mind. After seeing Jane like that, he couldn\"t even imagine what Alexandra\"s condition could be. Soon he stops to a curtain wall still in the hallway. Hands on the curtains he takes a deep breath and open them. Loki and\n",
      "Thor gasped in shock. A large chamber like structure greets them. \"This is called a Pressurized Oxygen Chamber. It\"s a chamber that holds pure oxygen in air pressure two to three times higher than normal. Alexandra has been in this chamber because he has carbon monoxide poisoning.\" \"What\"s that?\" Loki asked. \"Carbon Dioxide is a silent killer. In a normal residence there shouldn\"t be any, but when we were called, in Alexandra\"s home was filled with the highest amounts of Carbon Dioxide. When a mortal breaths, what they breath will not only go into the lungs, but everywhere in the\n",
      "body. When inhaled with the poison, it must be treated immediately. Unfortunately, in Alexandra\"s case, she\"s fighting for her life.\" He looks at the chamber. \"Not everyone gets the chamber therapy because it is only used for the deadly cases.\" Loki didn\"t know what to say. A poison is killing his princess? \"We have set up a camera to monitor her inside,\" he turns back to the gods, \"would you like to see her?\" \"Yes,\" Loki says quickly and edgerly. He pulls out a technology device and on the screen shows Alexandra lays flat on her back on a bed\n",
      "inside the chamber. She looks lifeless and almost looking dead. Loki\"s immortal heart stops seeing her like this. \"At this point,\" Doctor speaks again, \"she will be in the chamber for one more night and we will take both Alexandra and Jane in one room.\" \"Are they going....?\" Thor didn\"t want to finish the sentence. \"We\"re doing the best we could.\" *Next morning* No one couldn\"t sleep last night. Two friends are fighting for their lives. Loki and THor wanted to stay together for support and comfort. During breakfast, they didn\"t feel like eating. All they want is to get\n",
      "to the hospital as soon as possible. Especially for Thor and Loki. Each minute, maybe every second, goes by possibly to the point we will never see them anymore. Finally, their hospital visit begins. Jane still lays down in serious pain. Thor didn\"t want to get near her so he wouldn\"t increase it. A cloud of sadness cloak over everyone as they share the same thought. Jane forcefully looks to the door to see a couple of nurses wheeling Alexandra next to her. She\"s still unconsciousness from the poison, but she\"s breathing on her own. Alexandra is positioned funeral like\n",
      "which kills Jane inside. Father George stands on the other side of Jane, performing a prayer so Jane can find the way to Heaven. \"Now Jane,\" he says to her, having her look at him, \"go to the light.\" Her eyes move around trying to find it. Somehow when they land on Alexandra, there\"s the light. Alexandra\"s the light. Slowly she moves her hand up to reach her sister as she whispers, \"I am so sorry, I love you my little sister.\" After saying those words, her eyes closed and she takes her final breath. Alexandra suddenly awakes with her\n",
      "eyes wide open as she gasps loudly. She quickly sits up, trying to figure out what\"s going on. Onyx eyes look around for her surroundings. Everyone she knew is here, but when she turn to the female next to her, she stares at her for a few moments before letting her eyes closed and bowed her head in sadness knowing it is her sister. Chapter 24: *Alexandra\"s POV* After a week from the death, Jane\"s funeral arrived. I sit on the bed all dressed for the morning occasion. It\"s her favorite dress. She gave it to me one birthday because\n",
      "she didn\"t want to get rid of it and I fit in perfectly. My long hair falls down in waves as I try to lower the short skirt down more on my fishnet tights. Father George will be performing the funeral and yet I am not looking forward to it. A couple of tears begin to fall down my cheek and down to long sleeved arm. They won. My parents won. Their goal of making my life miserable has succeeded by taking the last person from my family. I no longer have an actually family. Familiar fingers run themselves against\n",
      "my cheek. My dark eyes meet the dark emeralds of my immortal prince. They are filled with emotions such as worry, concern, fear, etc. I gently grab his warm hand with cold hands. My eyes closed, trying not to cry. No words are spoken when he escorts me to the living room. Everyone gathers here before heading to the funeral home. Tony takes all of us there with one of his transportations. My head is low as I allow the silent depression cover my whole body. Everyone didn\"t make a sound which is good for this occasion. Soon we arrived\n",
      "to the funeral home where Father George has the body of Jane Foster. The team, Pepper, Thor, Loki, and I filled up the home with no outsiders. \"Today should have been a happy day knowing that the personal war finally come to an end,\" Father George speaks, performing the funeral, \"but we have lost a friend, a lover, and a sister. She will be deeply missed.\" Each member did a small speech for Jane and I am the last one. With a heavy heart, I stand in front of everyone. \"Jane Foster saw me as a sister even though I\n",
      "didn\"t know what a sibling was when her parents adopted me. No matter how much her parents hated me, she was there to love and protect me from anything. In return, I was there for her personal life problems. I couldn\"t be anymore grateful for having her in my life. I will always love and miss her dearly.\" I sit back down in my seat in between Thor and Loki. *The Tower* Later, she hang out in the living room area. All of us try to cheer up with the drinks and food provided for us, but we know that\n",
      "it\"s going to be a long healing process. I\"m sure that everyone will be better by tomorrow. As for myself, I am not sure how am I going to feel. \"...in terms of family,\" I overhear Father George talking to my teammates, \"she\"s truly alone.\" Tears silently fall, but in small rivers. So many years of crying in sorrow and now it feels like I cannot cry anymore. No matter how much my heart is broken. \"Lady Alexandra?\" Thor asked, coming up to me. \"Thor,\" I speak before looking down to the floor. \"My apologizes.\" \"Oh no Thor!\" I look\n",
      "up to him. \"It\"s my fault that Jane\"s gone.\" \"But she\"s your sister.\" \"Also your lover.\" \"I believe there\"s a Midgardian saying that things happen for a reason or people come into our lives.\" \"Yes there is.\" \"Maybe in a way, it\"s Jane that is letting you go so you can live your life. She will be watching you from Midgard Heaven wherever you go.\" Maybe he\"s right. Jane won\"t be taking care of me forever and in a strange way she\"s letting me go. I look up to my brother before hugging him. He hugs me back. Thor\"s my\n",
      "family in all of the realms. Everyone has given me their sympathy and empathy throughout the day. Loki holds me close, letting his warmth and comfort slowly take away the pain. \"Alexandra?\" he asked, brushing his fingers against my jaw and chin. \"Yes Loki?\" I look up to him. \"I was going to ask you within a few days, but if it\"s alright with you, I can ask you now.\" \"What is it Loki?\" \"My fate became to be king of Asgard,\" my eyes widen with a soft smile, \"but before I do become king, I would like for you\n",
      "to spend some time in Asgard.\" \"For how long?\" \"An Asgardian week.\" \"When do we leave?\" \"This Saturday.\" \"Loki,\" I smiled a little more, \"I would love to.\" He smiles, seeing me smile. *The next morning* \"Thank you so much for everything,\" I hugged Father George with a smile. \"You\"re very welcome,\" he hugs back, \"I just hoped it was going to end on a better note.\" \"Me too, but the house is gone for good.\" \"Yes indeed. Well,\" he smiles, looking at me, \"maybe the next time we see each other, it\"ll be you getting married.\" I chuckled, \"for\n",
      "sure.\" \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" He heads towards the entrance to his flight home. Chapter 25: *Alexandra\"s POV* All of my clothing has magically turn into more goddess like and more appropriate for Asgard. The dress I am wearing an emerald green strapless dress with a sheer black fabric over it in a similar form of a sleeveless coat or jacket. A thin golden ribbon ties everything together under my breasts. Long dark as night hair falls down my back and natural looking makeup on my face. I am packing up hoping I\"ve got everything I might need. Since Asgard is considered\n",
      "more simpler than Midgard, very few things are needed.

      "looking up with worry eyes.He didn\"t say another word just sling another rock into the water.

My hands turn into wrists as I forcefully slam them at the surface of the water. Making a splash. \"Where is he going?\" I asked\n",
      "softly, not really wanting to know.\"He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did. An\" the Committee granted it. Buckbeak\"s bin sentenced ter death.\" That hit it to the core. Tears run down my face and I sob, completely heartbroken. An innocent magical creature being put to death?

Suddenly they grew dead. \"Princess Abigail McGonagall\" and \"Peter Pettigrew\" are drawing closer to each other. Heart races. I quickly move towards the end of the corridor.
