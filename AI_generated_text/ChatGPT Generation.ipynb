If you come with us to Asgard, we can protect you.\\\" Loki gave me a smile as well, but it seemed like it was more out of amusement than sympathy. I felt my mind reeling at the thought of leaving everything behind for a world full of magic and gods. \\\"But what about my life here?\\\" I protested. \\\"My job, my friends...\\\" Thor shook his head. \\\"We can help you create a new life in Asgard. And as for your friends, they will understand that you're needed elsewhere.\\\" I couldn't deny the logic behind Thor's words. And maybe, just maybe, going to Asgard was what I needed to figure out my true purpose in life. \\\"Okay,\\\" I said finally. \\\"I'll go with you.\\\" Thor clapped me on the back, smiling. \\\"Excellent! We leave at dawn tomorrow. Pack what you need and meet us at the Bifrost.\\\" With that, the two gods left, leaving me to my thoughts. \\n\\nI spent the rest of the night packing a small suitcase and saying goodbye to my friends. They were all supportive of my decision, but it still hurt to leave them behind. As dawn broke, I made my way to the Bifrost, where Thor and Loki were already waiting. The two of them were dressed in their usual armor and looking ready for anything. \\\"Are you ready, Lady Alexandra?\\\" Thor asked, looking down at me with concern. \\\"As ready as I'll ever be,\\\" I said wryly. With a quick nod, Thor led me onto the Bifrost and we were soon transported to Asgard. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about Asgard was how beautiful it was. The buildings were made of gold and looked like they were carved out of the clouds. Everything around me seemed to glimmer and sparkle in the sunlight. It was overwhelming, in a way, but also breathtaking. As we walked through the city, I couldn't help but feel like I was walking through a dream. \\\"Welcome to Asgard,\\\" Loki said, giving me a smirk. \\\"Try not to drool too much.\\\" Thor rolled his eyes at his brother's antics, but I could tell he was amused. \\n\\nWe eventually came to a large palace that seemed to be made entirely of marble. It was breathtaking, with tall pillars and intricate carvings etched into the stone. \\\"This is the palace of Odin,\\\" Thor explained. \\\"He'll want to meet you, Lady Alexandra.\\\" My stomach did a nervous flip at the thought of meeting the All-Father, but I pushed down my nerves and followed the two gods inside. \\n\\nThe inside of the palace was just as grand as the outside. There were tapestries hanging from the walls, depicting battles and triumphs of the Asgardians. The floors were made of polished marble and looked like they had been scrubbed clean every day. We eventually made our way to a large throne room, where Odin was sitting on a high golden throne. He was an imposing figure, with one eye missing and long white hair that was braided down his back. \\\"Welcome, Lady Alexandra,\\\" Odin said, standing up from his throne. \\\"I have been expecting you.\\\" \\n\\nI felt my knees start to shake as I bowed low in front of the All-Father. \\\"Thank you for having me, your Majesty,\\\" I said nervously. \\\"I hope I can be of service to Asgard.\\\" Odin gave me a small smile. \\\"You already have been, Lady Alexandra. We have heard of your skills and your bravery. You will be an asset to our people.\\\" I felt a wave of relief flow over me at his words. Maybe coming to Asgard was the right decision after all. \\n\\nOver the next few weeks, I settled into life in Asgard. I was given my own chambers, which were spacious and decorated in gold and purple. I also started training with the Asgardian warriors, learning how to wield a sword and defend myself in battle. It was a grueling process, but I was determined to do well. Thor and Loki were both there to offer their support, and I quickly found myself becoming friends with other Asgardians as well. \\n\\nBut something was still bothering me. I felt like I had come to Asgard for a reason, but I didn't know what that reason was. It was like there was something just out of my reach, something that I needed to discover. One night, after a particularly hard day of training, I found myself wandering through the palace's gardens. There were flowers blooming everywhere, their sweet scent filling the air. As I walked, I found myself at a small pond, the water a deep blue in the moonlight. And that's when I saw her. \\n\\nShe was a woman, her body made entirely of water. Her hair was a bright green and her eyes were a deep blue. She smiled at me and beckoned me over. \\\"Who are you?\\\" I asked, walking to the edge of the pond. \\\"I'm Undine,\\\" she said. \\\"And you, Lady Alexandra, have been brought to Asgard for a purpose.\\\" \\n\\nI felt my heart race as Undine spoke. Could she be the key to unlocking the reason for my being here? She continued. \\\"You have been brought here to help us fight a great darkness that threatens all the realms. You are the key to defeating it.\\\" I felt a chill run down my spine at her words. To be the key to saving the world...it was a daunting task. But I knew that I had to do it. \\\"I'll do whatever I can to help,\\\" I told Undine. She gave me a small smile. \\\"I knew you would.\\\" \\n\\nOver the next few weeks, I trained harder than ever before. Undine appeared to me in my dreams, showing me visions of the darkness that threatened the nine realms. It was a dark, swirling mass of energy that seemed impossible to defeat. But I knew that I had to try. Finally, the day of the battle arrived. I stood on a battlefield with Thor and the rest of the Asgardian warriors, ready to face off against the darkness. It seemed like an impossible task, but I knew that together we could defeat it. \\n\\nThe battle was long and grueling. The darkness seemed to be everywhere at once, attacking our defenses from all sides. But we fought on, refusing to give up. I wielded my sword with everything I had, determined to not let my new home fall to the darkness. And finally, after what felt like an eternity, we emerged victorious. The darkness was defeated, banished to a far corner of the universe. \\n\\nAs the Asgardians celebrated, I found myself standing off to the side, watching everything happen. I felt something tug at my heart, a sense of sadness that I couldn't quite understand. That's when Thor appeared beside me. \\\"What's wrong, Lady Alexandra?\\\" he asked, looking at me with concern. I shook my head. \\\"I don't know. I just feel like there's something I'm missing.\\\" Thor gave me a small smile. \\\"Perhaps you will find what you're looking for in the future. But for now, we celebrate this victory.\\\" \\n\\nAnd celebrate we did. For the rest of the night, the Asgardians feasted and drank, letting off steam from the long battle. And as I looked around at the people I now called family, I knew that I had made the right decision to come to Asgard. I had found purpose and friendship in a world full of magic and gods. And I knew that whatever the future held, I was ready for it.\",\n",

There\"s nothing wrong with me and if you and the others continue.....you know what I don\"t want to be your sister anymore!\" Jane\"s screaming made everyone to see the screen. Alexandra sat there stunned as Jane storms off. Loki watches in fear to see his beloved princess about to break down. Thor feels his blood boiling inside, seeing this.\n",
      "*Alexandra\"s POV* Even well into the evening hours, the statement that Jane said is still fresh. I lost the last of my family because of that house. My nerves are shaking. Even though I have cried over things like this, tears will not come out. Am I in shock? I am drinking some iced water while staring out New York City through the some large windows. The city became home since I was eighteen years old when I joined the team. Friends with people that I would never have thought I will become friends with. Especially with Thor and Loki.\n",

A green tank top with black sweats clothed her body as she gets into bed. Loki\"s side feels cold, colder than his powers, not the familiar warmth coming from his body. Teary eyes look at the side as she slowly falls asleep. All of sudden, her head starts to feel weird. Hurting yet feeling dizzy even though she\"s laying down on her side. Deep breaths are made as she\"s having trouble\n",
      "of breathing. \"What\"s going on?' she asked to herself, opening her eyes in a panic. Before she can call out for help to JAVIS, she suddenly falls unconsciousness. *Asgard* Loki Laufeyson has chains on his wrists and ankles as he is in the palace dungeons. He\"s been here for hours to the point she doesn\"t know if it\"s still day or night. Fingertips touch the emerald on the golden chain that hangs around his neck. The princess of his dreams keep his spirits up. Visions of their future together appear before his eyes. Alexandra becoming one with Loki as king\n",

Loki really hopes that he gets the throne not only for him, but also for Alexandra. Even though Thor is willing to help her as well, he wants to give her a better life because she deserves it more then anything. Suddenly, two palace guards approach the energy force door.

      "to look up, \"please tell me about this mortal female that you have romantic feelings for.\" \"Her name is Alexandra,\" he answers softly, \"a young Midgardian female born with Asgardian beauty.\" This caught the All-Father\"s interest. \"She understands me more then anyone could because her past is simular to mine. Selfless, beautiful, intelligent, prefers the simpler life similar to Asgard. Her favorite forms of entertainment sparks my interests in reading, enjoying time together, and some of Midgardian entertainment.\" He touches the necklace once again. \"She has given me this as a gift for a tradition in Midgardian holiday called Christmas.\"\n",
      "He smiles softly, thinking of her then frowns sadly, \"No matter how much she tries to be good and protects Midgard with her magical powers, horrible things will continue on to take her down. She sees good in many thing that no one sees. She\"s Alexandra, Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" His majesty, the king, watches his youngest son describe this Goddess of Hidden Beauty. Such emotion and passion also love in his eyes. Loki is truly indeed in love. \"Loki,\" he finally speaks then smiles, \"you are next in line for the throne.\" Both brothers stare at their father stunned.\n",
      "\"Your mother had visions of a female from Midgard and always believe that you and her are meant to be. She kept in secrecy because she wanted you to fall in love wit her without knowing her.\" \"Father....\" Thor and Loki were speechless to hear this. \"You will take the throne as king along with your lady as queen. Now go inform Alexandra in Midgard. Also I would like to meet the Goddess of Hidden Beauty.\" \"Thank you Father,\" Loki smiles big to him. \"You are welcome King Loki,\" he smiles back. Thor and Loki leaves the throne room still\n",
      "stunned of what just happened. \"Congratulations Brother,\" Thor grins, pulling him into a hug. \"Is this for real Brother?\" Loki feels speechless. \"It is real Loki!\" he looks at him with his hands on his shoulders. \"You and Lady Alexandra are becoming King and Queen of Asgard!\" \"That\"s only if she accepts,\" Loki noted. \"She will accept. Now come on, let\" go and inform her!\" The grins appears on Loki\"s face again as they teleport to Midgard. Chapter 23: *No One\"s POV* *Midgard* For some odd reason, the gods were pulled to another location instead of the Tower. Then they\n",
      "step foot on the Earthly grounds, a horrible sight greeted them. Alexandra\"s childhood home is on fire! Flames are over twenty feet tall, covering almost every inch of the structure. Midgardian firefighters try to put out the fire when they see Tony in his Ironman suit flying around in a panic. \"Man of Iron!\" Thor calls for his teammate. \"Huh?\" Tony says confused, but notices the Asgardians on the ground. \"Thor! Reindeer Games!\" he calls back, flying down to them. Loki growls under his breath at the nickname. \"First of all, it has been a week since we last saw\n",
      "you two,\" Tony explained, \"and this week has gone bad to worse.\" \"Where are Lady Alexandra and Lady Jane?\" Loki asked, getting seriously worried. \"Alexandra has been in the hospital since the first night and we just got Jane into the hospital.\" \"What happened?!\" Thor asked, freaking out. \"Follow me and I will show you.\" The hospital is in the middle of the city and it\"s waiting room is filled with the team. You can see in their eyes that they\"re happy t see the Asgardian gods, but the happiness disappear due to the current situation. \"I am looking for\n",
      "the boyfriends of both Jane Foster and Alexandra Raymond-Foster,\" a head doctor asked, approaching the team. \"We are them,\" Thor speaks for them. \"Is Alexandra alright?\" Loki asked, softly, really concerned. \"Please come with me,\" the doctor says, walking back to where he was. Thor and Loki quickly follows him. He leads them to a room that has a curtain separating them from someone. It opens to reveal a sight that startles them gratefully. A female looking for wearing some clothing that\"s burned off and barely covering the nessoristy areas. Skin colored in deep red and hair is missing. The\n",
      "look in the female\"s eyes is filled with pure pain. \"Jane Foster,\" the doctor says to the gods, letting them approach her. The God of Thunder slowly walks to her side in disbelief. \"What happened to her?\" Loki asked the doctor. \"She was at the source of the fire in the home resulting her into untreatable bruns.\" \"You don\"t mean....\" \"I\"m afraid so. We are doing the best we could for now. Now let me show you Alexandra. Jane needs to focus on staying awake and breathing on her own.\" His brother slowly removes himself from Jane\"s room to follow\n",
      "Loki and the doctor. \"Take care of my sister,' The God of Mischief hears the mortal female speak to him through his mind. \"I will,' he responded through his mind. Doctor leads them to a far location of the hospital. THe long walk is making Loki more worried for his one true love. Thor has mixed emotions running through his mind. After seeing Jane like that, he couldn\"t even imagine what Alexandra\"s condition could be. Soon he stops to a curtain wall still in the hallway. Hands on the curtains he takes a deep breath and open them. Loki and\n",
      "Thor gasped in shock. A large chamber like structure greets them. \"This is called a Pressurized Oxygen Chamber. It\"s a chamber that holds pure oxygen in air pressure two to three times higher than normal. Alexandra has been in this chamber because he has carbon monoxide poisoning.\" \"What\"s that?\" Loki asked. \"Carbon Dioxide is a silent killer. In a normal residence there shouldn\"t be any, but when we were called, in Alexandra\"s home was filled with the highest amounts of Carbon Dioxide. When a mortal breaths, what they breath will not only go into the lungs, but everywhere in the\n",
      "body. When inhaled with the poison, it must be treated immediately. Unfortunately, in Alexandra\"s case, she\"s fighting for her life.\" He looks at the chamber. \"Not everyone gets the chamber therapy because it is only used for the deadly cases.\" Loki didn\"t know what to say. A poison is killing his princess? \"We have set up a camera to monitor her inside,\" he turns back to the gods, \"would you like to see her?\" \"Yes,\" Loki says quickly and edgerly. He pulls out a technology device and on the screen shows Alexandra lays flat on her back on a bed\n",
      "inside the chamber. She looks lifeless and almost looking dead. Loki\"s immortal heart stops seeing her like this. \"At this point,\" Doctor speaks again, \"she will be in the chamber for one more night and we will take both Alexandra and Jane in one room.\" \"Are they going....?\" Thor didn\"t want to finish the sentence. \"We\"re doing the best we could.\" *Next morning* No one couldn\"t sleep last night. Two friends are fighting for their lives. Loki and THor wanted to stay together for support and comfort. During breakfast, they didn\"t feel like eating. All they want is to get\n",
      "to the hospital as soon as possible. Especially for Thor and Loki. Each minute, maybe every second, goes by possibly to the point we will never see them anymore. Finally, their hospital visit begins. Jane still lays down in serious pain. Thor didn\"t want to get near her so he wouldn\"t increase it. A cloud of sadness cloak over everyone as they share the same thought. Jane forcefully looks to the door to see a couple of nurses wheeling Alexandra next to her. She\"s still unconsciousness from the poison, but she\"s breathing on her own. Alexandra is positioned funeral like\n",

Father George stands on the other side of Jane, performing a prayer so Jane can find the way to Heaven. \"Now Jane,\" he says to her, having her look at him, \"go to the light.\" Her eyes move around trying to find it. Somehow when they land on Alexandra, there\"s the light. Alexandra\"s the light. Slowly she moves her hand up to reach her sister as she whispers, \"I am so sorry, I love you my little sister.\" After saying those words, her eyes closed and she takes her final breath. Alexandra suddenly awakes with her\n",

Everyone she knew is here, but when she turn to the female next to her, she stares at her for a few moments before letting her eyes closed and bowed her head in sadness knowing it is her sister.

She gave it to me one birthday because\n",
      "she didn\"t want to get rid of it and I fit in perfectly. My long hair falls down in waves as I try to lower the short skirt down more on my fishnet tights. Father George will be performing the funeral and yet I am not looking forward to it. A couple of tears begin to fall down my cheek and down to long sleeved arm. They won. My parents won. Their goal of making my life miserable has succeeded by taking the last person from my family. I no longer have an actually family. Familiar fingers run themselves against\n",
      "my cheek. My dark eyes meet the dark emeralds of my immortal prince. They are filled with emotions such as worry, concern, fear, etc. I gently grab his warm hand with cold hands. My eyes closed, trying not to cry. No words are spoken when he escorts me to the living room. Everyone gathers here before heading to the funeral home. Tony takes all of us there with one of his transportations. My head is low as I allow the silent depression cover my whole body. Everyone didn\"t make a sound which is good for this occasion. Soon we arrived\n",
      "to the funeral home where Father George has the body of Jane Foster. The team, Pepper, Thor, Loki, and I filled up the home with no outsiders. \"Today should have been a happy day knowing that the personal war finally come to an end,\" Father George speaks, performing the funeral, \"but we have lost a friend, a lover, and a sister. She will be deeply missed.\" Each member did a small speech for Jane and I am the last one. With a heavy heart, I stand in front of everyone. \"Jane Foster saw me as a sister even though I\n",
      "didn\"t know what a sibling was when her parents adopted me. No matter how much her parents hated me, she was there to love and protect me from anything. In return, I was there for her personal life problems. I couldn\"t be anymore grateful for having her in my life. I will always love and miss her dearly.\" I sit back down in my seat in between Thor and Loki. *The Tower* Later, she hang out in the living room area. All of us try to cheer up with the drinks and food provided for us, but we know that\n",

As for myself, I am not sure how am I going to feel. \"...in terms of family,\" I overhear Father George talking to my teammates, \"she\"s truly alone.\" Tears silently fall, but in small rivers. So many years of crying in sorrow and now it feels like I cannot cry anymore. No matter how much my heart is broken. \"Lady Alexandra?\" Thor asked, coming up to me. \"Thor,\" I speak before looking down to the floor. \"My apologizes.\" \"Oh no Thor!\" I look\n",

She will be watching you from Midgard Heaven wherever you go.\" Maybe he\"s right. Jane won\"t be taking care of me forever and in a strange way she\"s letting me go. I look up to my brother before hugging him. He hugs me back. Thor\"s my\n",

      "We all breathed a sigh of relief as we watched it disappear into the night sky, but we knew this was only the beginning of our fight against Voldemort's forces. We had to be prepared for whatever else he might throw our way in order to protect our home and our\n",

I take a deep breath and try to compose myself. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whisper, not knowing what else to say. Hagrid nods and turns back to the lake, skimming more rocks across the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stand there in silence for a few moments before Hagrid finally speaks again. \"It's alright,\" he says softly. \"He had a good life here with me.\" He looks up at me with a sad smile on his face. \"He was a good hippogriff.\"\n",

      "I nod, not trusting\n",
      "myself to speak without crying. We stand there for a few more moments before Hagrid finally breaks the silence again. \"Come on,\" he says, turning away from the lake and heading back towards Hogwarts castle. \"Let's get you back inside.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "We walk in silence until we reach the gates of Hogwarts, where Hagrid stops and turns to me once more. He looks at me with an expression of understanding and compassion that I hadn't seen before in him. He reaches out and takes my hand in his own, squeezing it gently before letting go again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"It'll be alright,\" he says softly, giving me one last sad smile before turning away\n",
      "and walking off into the night. I watch him go until he disappears from sight, then turn away myself and head back inside Hogwarts castle, feeling strangely comforted by his words despite my sadness over Buckbeak's passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I follow the map, my heart pounding in my chest. I'm so close to finding out what happened to Buckbeak. I turn a corner and see Pettigrew standing there, talking to Lucius Malfoy. I can't hear what they're saying, but it's clear that Malfoy is trying to convince Pettigrew of something. I take a step closer and Malfoy notices me. He looks at me with a cold stare and then turns back to\n",
      "Pettigrew. \"You must do this for me,\" he says. \"It's the only way.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"What have you done?\" I demand, my voice shaking with anger and fear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Malfoy laughs coldly and steps forward as well, his wand pointed at me menacingly. \"I have done what was necessary,\" he says calmly. \"Buckbeak will be put to death tomorrow morning.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "My heart sinks as the reality of the situation hits\n",
      "me like a ton of bricks. Tears fill my eyes as I realize that there is nothing I can do to save Buckbeak now. But then an idea comes into my head - maybe there is something else that can be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me with a hint of surprise, as if he hadn't expected me to know the names. \"It's a Marauder's Map,\" he said, his voice softening. \"It shows the entire castle and grounds, and it can even show the location of certain people.\" He paused for a moment before continuing. \"I suggest you keep this map safe and use it wisely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded in agreement, feeling\n",
      "a bit overwhelmed by all of this information. I thanked Professor Snape for his help and tucked the map away in my pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I walked away, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of admiration for him. He had been so kind to me, despite his usual coldness. I knew that I could trust him with my secrets and that he would never betray me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I was surprised to find Professor Snape waiting for me outside my classroom door. He handed me an envelope with my name on it and said, \"This is from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.\" Inside was an invitation to join\n",
      "their secret club - The Marauders! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was ecstatic! I had heard stories about the Marauders from other students but never thought that I would be invited to join them! Professor Snape gave me a knowing smile before walking away without another word. \n",
      "\n",
      "That night, I met up with the Marauders in an old abandoned classroom on the seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle. We talked late into the night about our adventures and plans for the future. It felt like we were part of something special - something magical!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded and left the office, my mind racing with thoughts. I had to find Peter Pettigrew, but how? I knew\n",
      "he was in the castle somewhere, but where? I had to find him before Sirius Black did. As I walked through the halls of Hogwarts, I noticed a few students looking at me strangely. It was then that I realized that they must have heard about my mission. Word travels fast in this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued walking until I reached the Unknown House. It was a strange place, filled with secrets and mysteries. As soon as I stepped inside, a chill ran down my spine. The walls were lined with books and artifacts from all over the world. There were also strange symbols carved into the walls that seemed to\n",
      "be some kind of code or language.\n",
      "\n",
      "I searched through the bookshelves for any clues that might lead me to Peter Pettigrew, but nothing seemed to stand out. Then, suddenly, something caught my eye - a small book tucked away in one of the shelves. It was titled \"The Secret Life of Peter Pettigrew\". Could this be what I was looking for? \n",
      "\n",
      "I opened it up and began to read through its pages. It contained detailed information about Peter's life - his family background, his friends and enemies, and even his whereabouts at certain times of day! This could be exactly what I needed! \n",
      "\n",
      "Excitedly, I tucked the book into\n",
      "my bag and set off on my mission to find Peter Pettigrew before Sirius Black did!\n"

I sigh, lowering myself down to the water sitting on my knees. \"Buckbeak means a lot to me with him as one of my magical creatures,\" I speak, moving my hands around in the water. \"And yet Draco means the world to me.\"\"Buckbeak\"s not going back to the Forest.\" The response made me close my eyes tight in anger. My hands turn into wrists as I forcefully slam them at the surface of the water. Making a splash. \"Where is he going?\" I asked\n",
      "softly, not really wanting to know.\"He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did. An\" the Committee granted it. Buckbeak\"s bin sentenced ter death.\" That hit it to the core. Tears run down my face and I sob, completely heartbroken. An innocent magical creature being put to death? Hagrid joins me on the ground to pull me into a hug.Unknown to us, there was a certain young Malfoy watches us from afar with sadness in his eyes. \"I need to do something about this,\" he says to himself. \"Sorry Father, Princess Abigail\"s happiness means more to me than your\n",

When everyone is peacefully sleeping, my nightwear switch into my black pants, long sleeved shirt, lucky hat, and also flats. I leave my hair down because I am going to do it real quick, hopefully. The Marauder\"s Map lays in my hands as my feet takes me out of the Unknown House and onto the main grounds of Hogwarts. Taking a deep breath, the invisible cloak drapes over me. My vision grows sharper to see all of the\n",
      "crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of the castle on the parchment. \"Peter Pettigrew\" catches my eye. Daddy needs me to get him, well I need answers to my questions. I use my wand to lite a small light, enough for me to see through the darkness. Soft footsteps gently glides through the hallways. Suddenly they grew dead. \"Princess Abigail McGonagall\" and \"Peter Pettigrew\" are drawing closer to each other. Heart races. I quickly move towards the end of the corridor. On the map shows Pettigrew moves rather quickly down to the adjoining corridor. Soon we are merely seconds away. My\n",
      "wand and map clutched in my pumping chest. Glass covered eyes look to see where should have been Peter Pettigrew, but I see....myself?Myself reflected in a mirror. I am startled of just happened and quickly look down to the map to see Mr. Pettigrew moved past me. Light from my wand shows me where I am going next with being on his trail. Suddenly I hear footsteps behind me! The map shows me that it\"s Severus Snape!Quickly, the light turns off as I turn to be face to face with my Potions Professor. His dark eyes study where I am\n",
      "for a few moments before he roughly removes the cloak off of me. \"Princess Abigail,\" he speaks in his usual cold tone. \"What\"re you doing wandering the corridors at night?\" I didn\"t speak. A blush warms my face as my head bows in embarrassment. \"How extraordinarily like your uncle you are, your highness.\" That caught my attention. \"He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle-\"\"Please professor that is enough of my uncle.\"He simply stares at me with the usual coldness, but with a hint of love or happiness. \"What\"s in your arms?\" he asked, eying the map. \"Nothing,\" I\n",
      "answered quickly, placing it behind me.\"What. Is. In. Your. Arms?\" Professor Snape firmly asked again, almost staring me down with those amazing dark eyes. I find myself getting lost in his eyes before showing him the map.Once upon seeing it, he has bit of glitter in his eyes. \"And this. What might it be?\" \"Spare bit of parchment professor.\"\"Really....read it!\" he commanded me, showing me the map.Startled, I read it out loud, \"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and....\"\"Go on.\" \"...and the rest is a blur to me professor.\" \"Professor? Princess Abigail?\"We both turn\n",
      "to see Professor Lupin standing within the shadows. \"Well, well, Lupin,\" Professor Snape speaks. \"Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?\" \"Your highness,\" Professor Lupin says to me softly, appearing before me. \"You all right?\" \"That remains to be seen,\" Professor Snape answers for me. \"I\"ve just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from the young princess. Take a look Lupin,\" he gives him the map. \"This is supposed to be your area of expertise.\" My werewolf citizen takes the parchment.\"Clearly, it\"s full of Dark Magic.\" \"I seriously doubt that, Severus,\" Professor Lupin disapproves. \"It looks to\n",
      "me as if it merely insults anyone who tries to read it. I suspect it\"s a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. As you say, it\"s my area of expertise. Come with me Princess Abigail.\"I look back to Snape for a few moments before leaving with Lupin. He\"s fuming about what just happened. \"I don\"t know how this map came to be in your possession, Princess Abigail, but I\"m astounded that you didn\"t turn it in,\" he speaks to me. \"Did you ever stop to think that this - in the hands of Sirius\n",
      "Black - is a map to you?\" No words appear out of my mouth. \"Your uncle didn\"t set much store by rules either. But he and your aunt did give their lives to save your cousin\"s. Gambling their sacrifice by walking about the castle unprotected, with a killer on the loose, strikes me as a poor way to repay them. I won\"t cover up for you again your highness. Even though I want to.\" Lupin enters his office, tossing the map on his desk and begin to go through some papers. I stood at the doorway shocked, taking everything to\n",
      "heart. Why was he telling me stuff about my cousin and nothing about me? I need to tell Cousin Harry. \"Professor,\" I speak, with my back facing him. \"Whether the map works or not, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I need to find.\" \"And who was that, your highness?\" he asked. \"Peter Pettigrew.\" He hesitated a little before speaking, \"very well. I\"d like you to return to the Unknown House now. Oh and Princess Abigail? Don\"t take any detours.\"I look back to see him tap the map. \"If you do, I\"ll know.\" April 13, 1994 Divination class has\n",

Possibly each one is filled with murky smoke\"Relax....Let your mind....go...\" Professor Trelawney lectures.I stare into mine to see my reflection within the mist. \"Crystal gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye. Only then, will you...See. Oh my, what do we have here....?\"Professor Trelawney looks over to my cousin\"s crystal with curiosity. Hermione\"s eyes rolled. \"Here we go again. It\"s the Grim! It\"s the Grim.\"Then the professor narrows her eyes to one of my Gryffindor friends. \"My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed that you did not possess\n",

She simply rising gracelessly to exit. Her crystal ball is knocked off to the floor. Cousin Harry and I watch curiously as the ball rolls slowly out the doorway.\n"
